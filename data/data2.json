The permittivity of Spectacular is a whopping 18.5225 and the conductivity is a cheeky 0.9464. Prepare to be amazed!\n\nNow, when it comes to the receiver, we're talkin' precise coordinates here: 7319.679999999999, 1350.45 cm. Don't miss the spot, my friend. You wouldn't want to miss out on all the electromagnetic goodness, would you?\n\nHold your horses, because we're about to reveal the mind-boggling dimensions of the model. Get ready for this: it's a massive 4924.76 x 8260.06 cm. Oh yeah, we like 'em big!\n\nNow onto the source. It needs to be placed at the coordinates (5.7674, 21.2451, 57.9185) meters. Precision is key, my friend. So let's get it right and let the electromagnetic magic flow!\n\nOh, and by the way, the source is a voltage source. It's got a sassy internal resistance of 597.4622715283496 Ohms. You better believe it's got some resistance to backing down!\n\nNow, things get interesting with the polarization of the pulse. Are you ready? It's 'y'. That's right, we're bringing some serious pulse polarization swag to the table!\n\nHold on tight because we're about to hit you with the central frequency. It's a mindblowing 1824.601 MHz. I told you this Spectacular world was full of surprises!\n\nNow let's add a box with a twist. We'll call it Ambiguous, because why not? This box measures a cheeky 25.1585x37.6887 m, with a size to keep you on your toes: 1.0248. And don't forget, the permittivity of Ambiguous is a dashing 20.5169 with a conductivity of 0.714. It's got some personality, this Ambiguous character!\n\nOh, we can't forget about the pulse. It's gonna be gaussiandotnorm. Bippity boppity BOOM, we've got ourselves a pulse of electromagnetic awesomeness!\n\nNow, let's get random, baby! Generate those random layers and let the chaos unfold. It's like playing a game of electromagnetic roulette! Who knows what the layers will bring? Exciting, isn't it?\n\nBut wait, there's more! We're not done yet. We're adding another box, this time it's Spectacular taking the stage again. It's gonna be a box-bonanza! The left edge of Spectacular starts at 25.4412x46.3227 and the right edge ends at 28.0094x61.9802. Get ready for some electrifying boxy action!\n\nLast but not least, I know you're dying to know. How thick is the PML (perfectly matched layer)? It's a whopping 64-cell thick slice of electromagnetic heaven. We like our PMLs thick and juicy!\n\nAnd finally, let's set FDTD loose for a wild ride. We want it to run for a crazy 9433 iterations. Buckle up, my friend, because this Spectacular electromagnetic journey is gonna last a while!\n\nSo there you have it, my hilarious friend! Get ready for a Spectacular adventure with mind-blowing numbers, electrifying boxes, and random layers galore! Let's dive into the electromagnetic madness and enjoy the ride!",

We're going big, my friend!\n\nOkay, let's shake things up a bit. Let's make some random layers because who doesn't love surprises?\n\nWait for it... the time window will be 1.6048002269874026e-05 seconds.

Here we go:\n\n- Get ready to tune in to the groovy frequency of 4617649.421 KHz, baby!\n- The Labyrinth material thinks it's all fancy with a permittivity of 23.8998, but its conductivity is a measly 0.0316. It's like the material version of a wallflower at a party.\n- Time to create some random layers because life is unpredictable, just like this simulation apparently.\n- The signal's duration is a tongue-twisting 3.7378691220872396e-06 seconds. Blink and you'll miss it, folks!\n- The Banana material clearly skipped leg day with a permittivity of 5.6803, but its conductivity is off the charts at 0.9951. Talk about being all show and no substance!\n- Let's add a cube with Labyrinth material and play some geometry gymnastics. The left edge will be at the super precise coordinates of 1.9483x10.1365x34.2723 m, while the right edge will stretch all the way to 2.8837x10.2823x10.2742. We're cornering the market in cube placement!\n- Brace yourselves for the mind-blowing internal resistance of the voltage source - a whopping 462.66587845715344 Ohms! We're talking resistance that can withstand a nuclear explosion, folks.\n- Oh look, another cube! This time with Banana material. It's located at the coordinates 4.3402x3.6425x3.8064 m and it's got a little extra... with a size of 3.0299. It's like a cube on steroids!\n- Our discretisation step is a cool 107.89999999999999 cm. We're taking those baby steps, people!\n- Let's make this pulse party extra fancy with a gaussiandoubleprime pulse. Who knew pulses could have such extravagant names?\n- Our pulse source is getting its own VIP treatment at the coordinates (6.4149, 8.9627, 25.1883) meters. It's the pulse that rules them all!\n- The pulse is feeling a bit sassy and chooses to be polarized along the 'y' axis. You go, pulse! Show that axis who's boss.\n- The model's dimensions are as epic as a Hollywood blockbuster: 650.87 x 1039.82 x 3736.3199999999997 cm. We're going full IMAX with this simulation!\n- Rx is joining the coordinates party at 641.49, 896.27, 2518.8300000000004 cm. Rx knows how to navigate through the coordinate maze like a pro.\n- PML, which stands for Perfectly Matched Layer, is feeling extra thicc today with 65 cells. It's all about that extra protection, baby! Just like sunscreen for your simulation.",

Watch out, we're dealing with a high-tech Eyeball!\n\nOh, and just so you know, the polarization of our pulse is gonna be 'y'.

Gotta keep everything nice and protected!\n\nOh, and we can't forget about our faithful friend, Tx. It's gonna be a Hertzian Dipole. What a unique character!\n\nNow, let's not overlook the Flamingo here. Its permittivity is 16.3792, and the conductivity is 0.4971. This Flamingo means business!\n\nAnd there you have it, folks!

        "input": "Alright, here's a funny rewrite for you:\n\nDid you know that the permittivity of Serendipity is a mind-boggling 14.3608? It's like living in a land of endless surprises! And let's not forget about its conductivity, which is a cool 0.6331. A true electric character!\n\nOh, and get this, the central frequency is a whopping 4304479.174 KHz. Talk about hitting all the right notes! It's like the model is singing its own electromagnetic melody.\n\nNow, when it comes to dimensions, we've got a real beast on our hands. It's a model that stretches out to 4308.5 x 5547.99 x 5246.35 cm. It's like a giant electromagnetic monster taking over the room!\n\nAnd guess what? We're throwing in a cube with Serendipity! We're placing it with such precision, its left edge will be at 37.3281x39.5009x18.514 m, and the right edge at 39.7003x41.6947x56.0333. Serendipity is really making a grand entrance!\n\nBut hold on, we're not done yet. Our voltage source, Tx, comes with an internal resistance of 535.1582224159528 Ohms. It's like a sassy electrical current saying, \"Don't mess with me!\"\n\nAnd now, introducing our cuboid with Elephant! It's situated at 11.9707x39.1993x43.7541 m and has a size of 1.1705. Watch out, the Elephant is joining the electromagnetic party!\n\nTo ensure everything runs smoothly, we're making the PML 59 cell thick. It's like wrapping the whole model in a protective electromagnetic blanket.\n\nOh, and don't forget the source! We're placing it at the coordinates (28.495, 14.6532, 16.4055) meters. It's like the heartbeat of the model, pulsing with electromagnetic energy.\n\nJust to add a little extra randomness, we're throwing in some layers. Because, let's face it, electromagnetic models should also have a sense of style!\n\nNow, for the pulse, we're going with a quirky polarization. It's \"y\" for yes, please! Let's keep things interesting.\n\nAnd lastly, the discretization step will be a wacky 122.17 cm. It's like we're tiptoeing through the electromagnetic tulips, one giant step at a time.\n\nOh, and how could I forget? Rx, our faithful receiver, will be placed at the coordinates 2849.5, 1465.32, 1640.55 cm. It's like a game of electrical hide-and-seek!\n\nHope this funny version brings a smile to your face!",

A tapestry of measurements cascades forth, measuring 5350.42 x 674.8000000000001 x 6149.07 centimeters.\n\nNow, let us embark upon a journey into the realm of randomness. Activate the mechanisms that generate layers, enacting the dance of unpredictability.\n\nWe shall traverse through the plains of this algorithm, venturing forth for 16343 iterations, with each step cloaked in the discretization distance of 47.760000000000005 centimeters.\n\nAs we voyage through this realm, let the protective shield known as the PML encompass us, its thickness reaching a count of 36 cells.\n\nOh, dear pulse, let your energy vibrate with the polarization of 'x', as you surge through these ethereal pathways.\n\nLo and behold! Apple, the fruit of knowledge and nourishment, excels with a permittivity value of 7.3272, while its conductivity gracefully dances at 0.4767.\n\nOh, internal resistance of the voltage source! I beseech thee, manifest thy strength with a measure of 613.138451745412 Ohms.\n\nAnd now, we must designate the sacred coordinates for the placement of Rx, those sacred symbols of 323.47, 39.08, and 2011.33 centimeters.\n\nTx, with its powerful aura, shall be situated at the coordinates of 3.2347, 0.3908, and 20.1133.\n\nTx, the radiant Hertzian Dipole, shall grace us with its presence, illuminating the path ahead.\n\nLastly, let the pulse be of the ricker variety, its waveform echoing through the vast expanse of our creation.",

        "input": "Alrighty, here's the funny version:\n\nHey there! So, I've got this brilliant idea. Let's add a cube with a Cactus on its left edge. Picture this, the left edge of the cube should be at this super precise location, 6.2849x3.9527x13.1593 meters, and the right edge at 6.8422x6.4744x8.9655 meters. Cool, right?\n\nNow, let's talk about the receiver. We're gonna place it at these hilarious coordinates, (555.59, 424.47999999999996, 3993.5499999999997) centimeters. Yup, we like to keep things interesting with those decimal points.\n\nOh and get this, we're gonna make the PML (Perfectly Matched Layer) a hefty 28 cells thick. That's right, we don't do things halfway around here.\n\nOur trusty ol' Tx will be a voltage source. It's gonna bring all the energy to this party.\n\nNow, let's imagine the dimensions of our model. They're gonna be a whopping 1004.5 x 853.47 x 4079.61 centimeters. This thing is gonna be huge, you won't believe it!\n\nOh, and did I mention the internal resistance of the voltage source? It's a mind-blowing 463.7921371133408 Ohms. That's resistance with a capital R.\n\nWhen it comes to the pulse, we're going for the Ricker style. It's just fun to say, don't you think? Ricker, ricker, ricker!\n\nAlright, now let's pop that source right at these coordinates, 5.5559, 4.2448, 39.9355 meters. Boom! It's gonna be the center of attention.\n\nLet's get creative and make some random layers. Because why not add a little mystery and intrigue to our simulation?\n\nAnd get this, the polarization of the pulse is gonna be 'x'. Yeah, we like to keep things mysterious and unknown.\n\nWe're gonna let FDTD run its course for a grand total of 16583 iterations. Yeah, it's gonna keep going and going.\n\nAnd finally, let's not forget the discretisation step. It's gonna be a fabulous 27.089999999999996 centimeters. We like to keep things precise, but with a sense of humor.\n\nOh wait, there's more! The permittivity of Elephant is 22.1211 and the conductivity is 0.4835. Elephant power, activate!\n\nAnd as for our beloved Cactus, its permittivity is a solid 8.404, and the conductivity is a respectable 0.2519. Gotta give props to the Cacti too.\n\nLast but not least, let's add one more cube with an Elephant inside. It'll be at this funky location, 4.2352x1.8148x10.2674 meters, and it's gonna have a size of 2.8457. Elephant-ception, anyone?\n\nAnd that's a wrap! This simulation is gonna be a wild and wacky ride.

They are gonna be 25.3849 and 0.746, respectively. Important stuff, trust me.\n\nLet's not forget about the dimensions of the model. They are 8752.05 x 2308.2999999999997 centimeters. Big ol' model, huh?\n\nOh, and the discretisation step. Gotta have that. It's gonna be 193.64 centimeters. Not a random number, I promise.\n\nNow, let's talk about Dog. Yep, we're talking about it. The permittivity is 6.3085 and the conductivity is 0.6327. Interesting combo, huh?\n\nBy the way, the internal resistance of the voltage source is gonna be a whopping 794.576745696807 Ohms. Hello, resistance!\n\nAlmost done, folks. The PML, which stands for Perfectly Matched Layer, is gonna be 24 cell thick. Just throwin' that out there.\n\nAnd finally, the excitation pulse. It's gonna be the good ol' gaussian type. Classy stuff. Oh, and the polarization is gonna be 'y'. Whatever that means.\n\nAlright, last thing. The source. Gonna place it at the coordinates 38.8946, 1.9715. Nice, simple, and specific.",

Maybe it's the secret to unlocking the mysteries of the universe.\n\nOh, and let's not forget about time! We need a window of 1.2091393102023243e-05 seconds. Don't ask us why, it's just a really specific and kinda random number. Time is funny like that.\n\nNow, here's where things get even more ridiculous. We want the pulse to have the polarisation of 'y'. Because who needs boring polarisations like 'x' or 'z'? Nah, we're all about that 'y' life.\n\nBut wait, there's more! We're gonna add a box with our best buddy Pineapple. Yeah, you heard that right. Pineapple. It's gonna be epic. The left edge of this insane box will be at 9.4336x34.9343 and the right edge at 19.358x36.5974. Pineapple's got some serious dimensions, people!\n\nNow, let's get even crazier. We're gonna make some random layers. Why? Why not! It's all about embracing chaos and having a good laugh along the way.\n\nNext up, we're diving into frequencies. The central frequency will be a mind-boggling 2.384 GHz. That's right, we're going big or going home. No wimpy frequencies allowed!\n\nAnd what the heck is a Hertzian Dipole? Beats us!

We want it to be a thick boi, so we're going for 20 cells. Because thicker is always better, right?\n\nAnd finally, the star of the show - Pineapple! Its permittivity is 25.8923, and the conductivity is 0.4724. Who knew pineapples had such interesting electrical properties?\n\nBut wait, there's one more surprise. We're adding a box with our buddy Elephant. It's gonna be at 15.4212x40.7555 m with a size of 13.4396. Because why not? Elephants are cool.\n\nLast but not least, our excitation pulse is gonna be a gaussiandotnorm. We're not sure what that means, but it sounds fancy and fun.

        "input": "Alrighty, here's the funny version:\n\nHey there! So, I've got this crazy idea for you. Let's add a box with Sapphire that's a whopping 14.7443x25.1533 m in size, but get this, the box has a size of 9.2215. Talk about a little box with a big personality!\n\nNow, when it comes to the excitation pulse, let's go with a good ol' sine wave. It's just so wavy, you know?\n\nOh boy, the internal resistance of the voltage source is a mind-boggling 291.6866139631188 Ohms. That's a lot of resistance to handle. Can you feel the electricity in the air?\n\nNext up, we're gonna use a Hertzian Dipole named Tx. Sounds pretty fancy, huh? It's like we're in the future, communicating with aliens or something.\n\nNow, let's not forget about the discretisation step. We'll go with a precise 67.02 cm. Gotta keep things exact. No room for approximation here!\n\nFor the polarization of the pulse, let's make it 'y'. Why? Well, because 'y' not? It's a letter that needs some love too, you know!\n\nMoving on to Juxtapose. The permittivity is 19.7543 and the conductivity is 0.8358. Seems like Juxtapose just can't make up its mind. It's an electrically conflicted material, I guess.\n\nHold on to your hats, because the central frequency is a wild 3785968.195 KHz. That's some seriously impressive frequency right there. I wonder if we can use it to communicate with dolphins or something.\n\nNow, let's talk about the receiver. It needs to be placed at the coordinates 1942.2999999999997, 6108.23 cm. Can you imagine someone trying to find that exact spot? Good luck to them!\n\nSapphire is up next. Its permittivity is 16.9183 and the conductivity is 0.8598. Poor Sapphire, always trying to keep up with its more conductive peers. Hang in there, Sapphire!\n\nThe dimensions of the model are 2044.67 x 6750.46 cm. This model is like the supermodel of dimensions. So sleek and stylish, it'll turn heads wherever it goes.\n\nTo keep things nice and tidy, we'll make the PML 67 cell thick. Gotta maintain those boundaries, you know?\n\nNow, let's move the source to the coordinates 51.6144, 13.035. It's like playing a game of hide and seek. Good luck finding that sneaky source!\n\nLastly, the algorithm will run for a whopping 11726 iterations. That's a whole lot of computing power! Better grab some popcorn and settle in for the long haul.\n\nWait, wait, wait! I almost forgot. Let's also add a box with Juxtapose. The left edge should be at 11.1657x52.54, and the right edge at 18.3115x61.0462. It's like Juxtapose just couldn't resist being part of the fun!\n\nPhew! That was quite the adventure, wasn't it? I hope you're ready for some serious modeling and simulation magic. Let's go create some electromagnetic waves and make science proud!",

It's like having a party in your ears, except the music is electromagnetic waves!\n\nDon't forget to take small steps, my friend! The discretisation step is a mere 95.47 cm. We're like birds, hopping from one pixel to another, creating a masterpiece.\n\nOh, and did I mention that our buddy Tx is a voltage source? Yeah, that's right, it's like having your own personal superhero shooting out electromagnetic goodness!\n\nNow, let's talk dimensions.

Let's keep things exciting by generating some randomness. You never know what surprises await!\n\nBut hold on, safety first! We're gonna need a PML (Perfectly Matched Layer) to protect us. And this PML needs to be 94 cells thick. Now that's some serious armor against those unruly waves!\n\nNow, here comes the fun part. We're gonna add a box with a Chair inside.

This cube's got some interesting properties, with a permittivity of 9.9885 and a conductivity of 0.1602. Tiger sure knows how to rock the electrical characteristics!\n\nNow, let's talk about the transmitting antenna. We're gonna use a Hertzian Dipole, or as the cool kids call it, Tx. And guess where we're gonna place the receiver? At coordinates 10.6786, 23.0465, 1.1237. We wanna make sure we can catch all the action!\n\nBut wait, there's more! We need to set up the PML (perfectly matched layer) to protect ourselves from any funky reflections. We're gonna make it 87 cell thick, because hey, we like to be extra cautious!\n\nOh, and let's not forget about the random layers! We want the model to be completely unpredictable and keep us on our toes. Get ready for some surprise fun!\n\nNow, let's talk about the pulse. We want its polarization to be 'y'. Gotta keep it fancy, you know? And the discretisation step? Well, it's gonna be a whopping 42.91 cm. We like our steps big and bold!\n\nThe signal's gonna be short but sweet, lasting only 1.5612404041508857e-05 seconds. So make sure you don't blink, or you might miss it!\n\nBut wait, we're not done yet. We've got another cube coming in hot! It's called Spectacular, and it's gonna be at coordinates 47.6477x74.5012x36.1319 m, with a size of 19.6929. Spectacular likes to make a statement, you know?\n\nAs for its properties, Spectacular has a permittivity of 25.817 and a conductivity of 0.1042. It's got some serious style!\n\nAnd where do we place the source for this cube? At coordinates 52.2404, 7.3699. We wanna make sure we get the best view of the spectacle!\n\nThe pulse for Spectacular is gonna be none other than the gaussiandoubleprime. We like our pulses fancy and unique!\n\nNow, get this: we're gonna rock a central frequency of 4077.641 MHz. We gotta make some noise and keep things exciting!\n\nAnd finally, the dimensions of the model are gonna be a massive 6295.12 x 9181.42 x 4648.82 cm. We like to go big or go home!\n\nAlright, buckle up and get ready for an amazing adventure with Tiger, Spectacular, and all the crazy elements in between.

And hold on tight because the central frequency is a mind-boggling 2.693 GHz! \n\nNow, let's add some random layers because what's a good experiment without a little chaos thrown in, right? And just to keep things interesting, let's make the polarization of the pulse do the 'x' thing. \n\nNext up, I'm going to add a box with Sunflower on the left edge at some ridiculous coordinates like 42.4089x17.3527 and the right edge at 44.1741x20.8921 (because why not, right? We're going all-out with this Sunflower extravaganza!). \n\nNow, I need FDTD to run for a whopping 9996 iterations. Yep, you heard that right, we're going the distance with this experiment! \n\nOh, and don't forget the discretisation step of 29.25 cm because we need to be precise here (as if anything in this experiment makes sense). And let's make the PML 9 cell thick just to keep things fancy. \n\nNow, let's talk about the Hertzian Dipole, or as I like to call it, the \"Tx\" (because why use normal terminology when we can make things confusing?). \n\nFor the Rx (which is just a fancy way of saying the receiver), let's place it at the oh-so-specific coordinates of 1.9936, 11.7244 meters (because precision is everything in this crazy experiment). \n\nNow, brace yourself for some random numbers, because the internal resistance of the voltage source is a mind-blowing 504.5153136327417 Ohms (because who needs round numbers, right? Let's make things complicated!).\n\nMoving on, the dimensions of the model are a gigantic 4858.03 x 4466.42 cm (because we need a model that's big enough to contain all this craziness). \n\nAnd just to throw a Celestial curveball into the mix, let's add a box with Celestial at 33.7303x35.3205 meters and add a little spice with a size of 10.6511 (because why not have multiple random things happening at once?). \n\nPhew, that's quite the experiment we've got going on here!

The source, let's call it \"The Magically Meandering Machine,\" will be chilling at the coordinates 1.1067, 32.4124. Yes, those are some very specific coordinates. Gotta be precise, you know?\n\nNow, we're going to spice things up by adding a box to the left of our machine. We'll call it \"Flamingo's Fancy Flap\" because why not? This box will start at 61.4013x30.6516 and end at 81.3297x32.1492. Don't you just love those flamingos? They'll surely add some pizzazz to our experiment!\n\nOh, and get this \u2013 the pulse's polarization will be 'y'. That's right, it's going to be saucy and ready to party.\n\nBut hold on, we gotta make sure our experiment is legit. So, we'll make our PML (Perfectly Magic Layer) super thick, like 81 cells thick. We don't want any funny business sneaking into our results, you know?\n\nNow, let's talk about our discretisation step, which sounds super fancy. We're going to take it to the next level by using a discretisation step of 26.840000000000003 cm. Yeah, those decimal points are not messing around. We're all about precision here!\n\nAnd guess what? We're not stopping there! We're going to bring in another box, because one box is just not enough. This time, we'll call it \"Aquarium Adventure.\" It'll be located at 70.8858x33.8256 m (because meters make everything cooler) and its size will be 31.9286. That's one big fish tank! We've gotta fill it up with some epic aquatic creatures later.\n\nBut wait, there's more \u2013 this Aquarium has its own special properties. The permittivity is 5.996 and the conductivity is 0.0569. This thing is going to be buzzing with electricity! Don't worry, we're all professionals here... sort of.\n\nNext up, we've got to generate some random layers because surprises make life more exciting. Who knows what wonders we'll discover in these layers?\n\nNow, let's talk about the voltage source, our good buddy \"Tx.\" We need that spark of energy to make things happen. The model's dimensions, in case you were wondering, are a whopping 9869.48 x 7954.9800000000005 cm. Yeah, it's a beast!\n\nBut don't worry, we've got some resistance in this circuit. The internal resistance of the voltage source is a mind-bogglingly specific 939.5931810233084 Ohms. Safety first, folks!\n\nThe pulse we're using is the one and only \"gaussiandotnorm.\" Just rolls off the tongue, doesn't it? This pulse is going to rock our experiment like a rockstar!\n\nNow, let's talk about our receiver. We've strategically placed it at the coordinates (8728.63, 5969.83) cm. That's where all the action is going to happen. Get your popcorn ready!\n\nAh, and let's not forget the central frequency. It's set to a cool 3.092 GHz. We're going to be shaking the foundations with this frequency!\n\nLast but definitely not least, we've got to mention Flamingo's secret sauce. Its permittivity is 20.538 and the conductivity is 0.0282. Flamingo is going to make waves with its unique properties!\n\nAnd there you have it, folks \u2013 our wild and wacky experiment ready to blow your socks off!

And then, get this, the FDTD needs to run for, like, exactly 9629 iterations. Can you believe it? \n\nOh, and the polarization of the pulse is gonna be 'x'. Gotta keep it stylish, you know? And get this, the model's dimensions are gonna be, like, a whopping 6537.17 x 8727.37 cm. It's gonna be epic! \n\nSo, the transmitter, oh boy, it's gonna be a Hertzian Dipole. Can't go wrong with that, you know? And the receiver, well, it's gotta be, like, over at these funky coordinates, man. Just slap it down at 1.8721, 61.7168 meters.\n\nAnd, ooh, here's a fun one! The PML, yeah, it's gotta be, like, 69 whole cell thick. Gotta stay protected, ya know? Can't have any funny business interfering with our box!\n\nOh, and the pulse, man, it's gonna be gaussianprime. Super fancy-schmancy! Gotta make sure it's hitting all the right notes, you dig?\n\nNow, here's the kicker, man. We gotta add another box. This time, let's call it Bumblebee. It's gonna be all the way over at, like, 55.4464x77.2606 meters. And, oh, it's gonna be a nice size, you know? Like, 10.6954.

And, uh, the permittivity of Banana, well, it's gonna be, like, 6.8977. And, uh, the conductivity, yeah, that's, like, 0.3732. Just a couple of cool numbers, you know? \n\nAnd finally, man, the discretisation step, uh, let's make it, like, 57.46 cm. Gotta have that precision, you know?\n\nAnd there you have it!

Just thought I'd let you in on the secret.\n\nNow, the dimensions of this model we're building. It's gonna be a whopping 2152.6499999999996 x 6732.299999999999 cm. We're creating a giant, my friend!\n\nBut hey, time is of the essence. The time window should be a quick 1.7906159365913598e-05 seconds. We don't have time to waste, we gotta get this simulation running!\n\nAnd lastly, but definitely not leastly, the Train's permittivity is a cool 21.1024, and its conductivity is a sassy 0.5844. We've got some high-class conductivity up in here!\n\nOh, and the Tx source? It should be placed at the coordinates 20.5258, 34.8462 meters. We're gonna send some serious voltage from there!\n\nAlright, my friend, that's all the fun we can handle for now. Let's get to work and make some electromagnetic magic happen!",

Yeah, no one knows what it means either, but we're gonna roll with it!\n\nNow, hold on to your hats, because the discretisation step is gonna be a whopping 80.15 cm. That's like taking tiny little steps in a giant world.\n\nAlright, let's get creative with this cube situation. We're adding a cube with Sapphire that's gonna be all fancy and measure 34.6801x39.9911x38.871 m. And don't forget the size - it's gonna be a cool 13.8606.

He's got some serious power!\n\nOkay, now let's talk about the permittivity and conductivity. Sapphire, the stone of elegance, has a permittivity of 18.2518 and a conductivity of 0.5813. It's like having bling in our model!\n\nOh, but wait, we're not done yet. Introducing the cube with Chocolate. Mmm, delicious!

The central frequency is gonna be a mind-blowing 4582882.563 KHz. That's like the sound of a million tiny beats!\n\nAnd last but not least, the dimensions of this model are gonna be massive.

Not just any box, mind you, a really specific box with dimensions of 15.1964x90.7364 m, because who doesn't love a precise box for their elephant? And hey, let's make the box size 6.1776, because why not?\n\nNow, here's the kicker: the signal coming out of this box is only gonna last for a teeny tiny 9.388964487302733e-06 seconds. Blink and you'll miss it, folks!\n\nBut wait, there's more! We need a source for this whole shebang, and we're gonna place it at the coordinates 68.5985, 75.1439. Nice and specific, just like this whole situation.\n\nBut wait, wait, wait, there's more! This source comes with its own internal resistance, because why not add some resistance to our lives? It's gonna be 224.4788165728815 Ohms. Gotta keep those electrical currents on their toes, you know?\n\nAnd guess what? We get to choose the polarization of the pulse, and we're going with 'y'. Yup, that's right, we're gonna pulse this thing in a Y-shaped fashion. Get ready for some crazy polarized action!\n\nNow, for the fancy transmitter, we're using a Hertzian Dipole, because nothing says \"I'm transmitting some serious stuff\" like a good ol' Hertzian Dipole. Classic.\n\nOh, and get this: the central frequency is gonna be a mega cool 74.572 MHz. It's like the hippest frequency around, you know? All the cool kids are using it.\n\nBut hey, let's not forget to throw in some random layers, because life is just too predictable without them. Randomness makes everything better.\n\nNow, onto the fun facts about our materials! Did you know that the permittivity of pineapple is 19.5283? That's right, pineapples have their own permittivity. And just to make things interesting, let's add a conductivity of 0.2869. Who knew pineapples could conduct electricity?\n\nBut wait, here comes the real kicker: the permittivity of the elephant is 11.1321, and its conductivity is 0.2315. Elephants conducting electricity? That's a sight to see!\n\nOh, we can't forget about the receiver! It needs a spot too, and we're gonna place it at the oh-so-specific coordinates of 6859.85, 7514.39 cm. Precision is key, my friend.\n\nNow, how about that discretisation step? Let's make it a cool 44.74 cm. Not too big, not too small, just right for all our needs.\n\nAnd finally, we need some protection. Let's surround everything with a PML (Perfectly Matched Layer), but not just any PML. Oh no, this PML is gonna be 48 cell thick. Because if we're gonna protect our elephant and pineapple-filled box, we better do it right!\n\nSo there you have it, my friend.

So, hang tight as I walk you through the madness.\n\nFirst off, we've got this \"Dragonfly\" character with a permittivity of 25.8315 and a conductivity of 0.6148. Sounds like this Dragonfly is quite the electric bug! Now, we need to place our Tx source at the coordinates 36.8403, 31.6507 meters. Just make sure you don't step on any dragonflies while you're setting up!\n\nNow, let's keep the fun going and generate some random layers! You never know what surprises they might bring.\n\nBut wait! We can't forget about our good friend Spoon! Let's give Spoon some screen time by adding a box. Picture this: Spoon's left edge starts at 26.9198x91.7001 and the right edge's at 40.7385x91.9141. It'll be a boxy masterpiece!\n\nOh, right! Our Tx is actually a voltage source. Just a little detail to keep in mind, nothing too shocking.\n\nSpeaking of shocking, let's beef up our PML by making it a whopping 76 cell thick. Gotta keep those electromagnetic waves in check!\n\nNow, let's talk dimensions. The model is a whopping 4702.38 x 9379.07 cm. That's big! Give yourself plenty of room to stretch your legs in that model.\n\nAlright, back to Spoon. Spoon's got a permittivity of 6.0143, and a conductivity of 0.9994. Talk about being electrically charged! Watch out for any flying spoons!\n\nThe central frequency is gonna be a cool 0.983 GHz. Not too shabby!\n\nFor the pulse, let's keep it wild and go with gaussiandotdot. It's a pulse that knows how to make some noise!\n\nOh, and don't forget about the internal resistance of our voltage source. It's a crazy specific number - 88.67076386067107 Ohms. How they came up with that, I have no idea!\n\nNow, we're adding another box, but this time it's with our good ol' \"Dragonfly\". We'll place it at 29.6876x93.7699 m with a size of 22.8231. Gotta give Dragonfly some space to spread its... wings?\n\nAnd now, let's set up our receiver at the coordinates (5780.65, 2398.61) cm. They'll be ready to catch all the electromagnetic madness coming their way!\n\nWhat else? Ah yes, the polarization of the pulse. Let's go with 'x' because it's a pretty cool letter, don't you think?\n\nLastly, we gotta pick a discretisation step. Let's go with a quirky 90.53 cm. We might as well keep things interesting!\n\nAnd there you have it! Our wacky adventure in the world of electromagnetic modeling. Have fun with all those electric bugs and spoons, my friend!",

And just so you know, the internal resistance of this source is a mind-boggling 86.3383439713088 Ohms! \n\nNow, let's add some spice to this simulation with a ricker pulse. Oh, and don't forget to make the PML a hefty 67 cells thick. Gotta keep things under control, you know?\n\nMoving on, we're gonna add another box, but this time, it's gonna be a lion! Yup, you heard me right! Place that fierce feline at 16.4879x53.3995 meters and give it a size of 3.6182. Let the lion roam free in our simulation!\n\nBy the way, the dimensions of this whole shebang are a whopping 2650.47 x 5922.51 cm. Talk about a massive scale!\n\nNow, let's get down to the nitty-gritty. The polarization of our pulse is gonna be 'y'. Oh, and the receiver? Stick it at 2469.21, 1343.86 cm. And give it a time window of 8.639699315427274e-06 seconds. Time is of the essence, my friend!\n\nDon't forget, our trusty source is gonna be a voltage source, labeled 'Tx'. Now, here's where things get really wild. The permittivity of our lion is a staggering 13.8817, and it's got a conductivity of 0.2898. Ain't that electric?\n\nOh, and let's throw in some random layers while we're at it. Keep things interesting, you know?\n\nNow, the central frequency of this whole shebang is gonna be a mind-blowing 236359.507 KHz. Get ready to feel the vibrations!\n\nLast but not least, let's not neglect our cupcake. This sweet treat has a permittivity of 4.6697, accompanied by a pinch of conductivity at 0.637. Yum!\n\nAnd to tie it all together, the discretization step should be a cool 194.12 cm. We gotta keep things precise and pixel-perfect, folks!\n\nThere you have it, folks!

Ohms my goodness!\n\nNow, hold on tight because the Perpetually Mysterious Layer (PML) is going to be a whopping 88 cells thick. That's thicker than a stack of pancakes!\n\nOh, and don't even get me started on the Sundial. Its permittivity is a mind-numbing 19.2429, and its conductivity is a shocking 0.74. I mean, who knew a Sundial could be so electric?\n\nLet's add a box, shall we? We'll make it 1.0214 by 12.1556 meters with a size of 1.2207. Just the perfect box to store all your time-seeking needs!\n\nNow, get ready to groove because the central frequency will be a funky 2019.267 megahertz. That's some seriously groovy vibes!\n\nWhere should we place the source, you ask? Well, how about at coordinates 2.9121 by 1.2227? It's the perfect hideout for our electric friend.\n\nHold on to your squirrel friends because we're adding another box, this time with Squirrel vibes. We'll position the left edge at 0.986 by 12.3911, and the right edge at 2.5641 by 17.552. It's time to go nuts with this one!\n\nNow, let's talk pulses. We want them to be as smooth as a squirrel's glide, so we'll go with a Gaussian excitation pulse. Smooth and spicy!\n\nThe model's dimensions are a whopping 357.52000000000004 by 2478.4300000000003 centimeters. That's one big model! It's like the supermodel of electromagnetic simulations.\n\nAh, the Squirrel strikes again! Its permittivity is a dazzling 25.7055, and its conductivity is a jazzy 0.7815. It's electric, boogie woogie woogie!\n\nLet's have some fun and generate random layers. Layers always make everything a little more exciting, don't you think?\n\nNow, where do we want the receiver? Let's stick it at coordinates 194.28 by 1409.03 centimeters. It'll be a real receiver of electromagnetic secrets!\n\nThe signal's duration will be a teeny, tiny 3.586568489404455e-06 seconds. Blink, and you'll miss it!\n\nYou know what they say, \"Tx is a Hertzian Dipole!\" It's like a fancy jazz musician playing electric tunes in the electromagnetic realm. Smooth vibes all around!\n\nLast but not least, the polarization of the pulse should be 'x'. Sounds mysterious, doesn't it? Just the right touch to make things interesting.\n\nThere you have it, my friend. A funny twist on your request that'll make anyone chuckle and spark some electrifying excitement!",

Brace yourself for some outrageous numbers and mind-boggling coordinates!\n\nSo, the permittivity of Lamp is a mind-blowing 11.1324, while the conductivity is just a measly 0.1231. And hold on to your hats, because Tranquil takes it up a notch with a permittivity of 15.6367 and a conductivity of 0.2276. Wowza!\n\nNow, let's talk about some crazy coordinates. The Rx needs to be placed at the mind-numbingly precise spot of 1943.2200000000003, 2390.33, 385.46999999999997 centimeters. And to keep everything nice and snug, the PML should be a whopping 7 cells thick. Safety first, folks!\n\nBut wait, there's more! The pulse we're using is none other than a good ol' sine wave. And to keep things interesting, let's place the source at the super snazzy coordinates of (19.4322, 23.9033, 3.8547) meters. Can you feel the excitement in the air?\n\nNow, let's bring in some randomness! Just for fun, let's add some layers that are totally random. The more chaotic, the better!\n\nAh, yes, it's time for cubes! Let's add a cube with Lamp, because why not? The left edge of this wild cube should be at a mind-bending 50.3586x38.9753x16.6907 meters, while the right edge is a mind-boggling 54.2031x69.5606x66.4455 meters. Get ready for some mind-altering dimensions!\n\nOh, and don't forget, the internal resistance of the voltage source is a whopping 412.4925002967896 Ohms. That's some serious electrical power right there!\n\nNow, hold on to your seats, because we're about to reveal the dimensions of the model. Brace yourselves for 5486.41 x 7641.87 x 6346.200000000001 centimeters of pure modeling magic! Prepare to be amazed!\n\nAnd get ready for a bit of polarization pizzazz, because the polarization of the pulse should be 'x'. It's just how we roll in the world of craziness!\n\nTo top it all off, let's run the algorithm for a mind-blowing 25767 iterations. We're in this for the long haul, folks!\n\nBut wait, we're not done yet! Let's add another cube, this time with Tranquil. Picture this: a cube at the coordinates 34.9335x35.8954x52.09 meters, with a mind-bending size of 21.5325. Is your mind blown yet?\n\nLast but not least, the discretization step should be a mind-boggling 169.82 centimeters. We're all about precision in this wild ride!\n\nAnd to add some extra oomph, the central frequency will be a jaw-dropping 1308.448 MHz. Prepare to be hit with some serious frequency vibes!\n\nAnd there you have it, my friends, a wild and wacky configuration that will definitely keep things interesting. Buckle up and enjoy the ride in the crazy world of Lamp, Tranquil, and all things mind-boggling!",

Bet you've never heard of a resistance that precise before!\n\nNow, let's talk about the pulse polarization. We're going with the letter 'y'. Because, you know, polarizing your pulse with a letter just adds that extra pizzazz.\n\nNow, let's discretize the step. And for that, we've got a lovely 91.52 cm. Because who needs round numbers, right? We like to keep things interesting.\n\nOh, and did I mention we're adding a box? Yep, a cute little box named Cucumber.

That's a lot of calculations, so get your math hats on!\n\nAnd finally, let's talk about PML. It's going to be 38 cell thick. PML, our little shield against unwanted reflections and echoes.\n\nPhew!

The internal resistance of the voltage source is a whopping 708.7734966365562 ohms. That's a lot of resistance, my friend.\n\nNext up, we need to set a time window for our shenanigans. How about 7.498408063989197e-06 seconds? Yeah, that's the perfect amount of time for some hilarious experiments.\n\nOh, and get this - we're gonna make our PML (perfectly matched layer) 13 cell thick. Because, you know, 13 is the lucky number for all our electromagnetic adventures.\n\nNow, let's spice things up with a pulse. We'll make it gaussiandotdot. Who came up with that name? I have no idea, but it sounds cool, so let's go with it.\n\nTo receive all the wacky signals, we're gonna place the receiver at coordinates 45.543, 18.6294, 5.4479. Oh, and guess where we'll put the source? Yep, at the exact same coordinates. It's gonna be a wild ride, my friend.\n\nNow, let's talk numbers. The dimensions of our model are 5413.87 x 9385.890000000001 x 5295.16 cm. Yeah, it's gonna be massive. We like to go big or go home.\n\nAnd let's not forget about Flamingo. The permittivity of Flamingo is 11.7482 and the conductivity is 0.1242. Who knew flamingos had electromagnetic properties? Not me, but hey, we'll work with it.\n\nTo add some randomness to the mix, let's throw in some random layers. Because who needs order when you can have chaos?\n\nOh, and just a heads up, the discretisation step will be a cool 90.34 cm. Gotta keep things funky, you know?\n\nAnd finally, our voltage source will be called Tx. Short and sweet, just like us.\n\nLast but not least, let's add another cube with Flamingo. We'll place it all fancy-like. The left edge should be at 39.3057x88.5529x23.729 m, while the right edge will be at 46.6938x92.1604x89.3651. It'll be a Flamingo extravaganza!\n\nOh, and one more thing - the polarization of our pulse will be 'x'. Because who needs boring old polarizations when you can have an 'x'?\n\nAnd let's not forget about the central frequency. It'll be a rocking 3.363 GHz.

We're gonna set the central frequency at a mind-boggling 1282.814 megahertz. That's some serious brain power!\n\nOh, and don't forget about our trusty voltage source with an internal resistance of 883.2956189149818 ohms. That's some serious electric mojo right there!\n\nNow, let's run our algorithm for 16408 iterations. We're gonna crunch those numbers like nobody's business!\n\nAnd guess what? We're gonna use a pulse called gaussiandotdotnorm. It's gonna be the hippest pulse in town!\n\nLet's get creative and make some random layers. You never know what surprises they might hold!\n\nOh, and the polarization of our pulse? It's gonna be 'y'. Don't ask me why, it's just the way it vibes!\n\nLast but not least, we gotta position our source. Let's place it at the coordinates (45.543, 18.6294, 5.4479) meters. Boom! We're ready to rock this scientific party!\n\nHope that brought a smile to your face while we covered all that technical stuff. Let's go unleash some science magic!",

And to make things even wackier, the discretisation step should be a mind-boggling 58.13 cm. Can you even handle it?\n\nMoving on to some strange electromagnetic waves. We'll use a Hertzian Dipole named Tx, but wait for it... the pulse will be gaussianprime! Sounds like an exotic coffee, doesn't it? Oh, and make sure the pulse is polarized along the 'x' axis. Gotta keep those pulses fashionable!\n\nHold onto your circuit boards, because we're diving into electrical resistance. The internal resistance of the voltage source is a mind-numbing 801.8049198526413 Ohms. That's a whole lot of resistance! Someone had a bad hair day in the lab.\n\nNext up, the dimensions of our model are a mind-blowing 4056.6400000000003 x 7992.31 cm. Whoa, that's... rather specific, isn't it? But hey, precision is the name of the game in the wacky world of modeling.\n\nLet's throw an Octopus into the mix, because why not? We'll add a box with Octopus inside, and get this: the left edge should be at 36.4278x54.9297, while the right edge will be at 39.9065x76.2788. It's gonna be one tight squeeze for that Octopus!\n\nTime for some strange protection methods. The PML (Perfectly Matched Layer) needs to be a whopping 30 cells thick. Can't have any electromagnetic leaks, can we? Safety first!\n\nAnd finally, let's place a mysterious Rx at the coordinates 23.5035, 36.6757 meters.

We don't want them to miss each other.\n\nOh, and in case you're curious, the permittivity of Octopus is 16.5048 with a conductivity of 0.6683. Who would've thought an Octopus could conduct electricity? Nature is full of surprises!\n\nAnd just because we like to keep things interesting, let's throw in some random layers. Because why not? Life is too short to be boring, so let's make our science projects as random as possible!\n\nHope you had a laugh while diving into this wacky world of science!

It's gonna be a hip 2.982 GHz. \nBut wait, we can't ignore the Falcon! It has its own style with a permittivity of 3.8169 and booboo conductivity of 0.9908. You go, Falcon! \nNow, when it comes to the Tx, we're talking about a Hertzian Dipole.

        "input": "Alrighty then, here's the funny version:\n\nSo, I wanna slap on a thick PML that's 30 cells wide, because you know, why not? And let's make sure the pulse is polarized with a big ol' \"y\" to really spice things up. Oh, and the central frequency? Let's go wild with 2328605.093 KHz! Can't wait to jam out to that.\n\nNow, here's the fun part. We gotta run the algorithm for a whopping 1224 iterations because why settle for anything less? And let's generate some random layers just for kicks and giggles. Gotta keep things interesting, am I right?\n\nAnd let's not forget the fancy box. Picture this: a box painted in Cerulean, because we gotta bring some color to the party. We'll slap it on with the left edge at 41.1736x5.9315 and the right edge at 57.5585x7.1509. Boom, instant style.\n\nNow, let's talk about the receiver. We'll place it at the coordinates (2182.57, 65.99000000000001) cm, because my inner GPS says so. And oh boy, the internal resistance of the voltage source? A whopping 443.5866796862142 Ohms! That's a lot of resistance for a tiny little source.\n\nSpeaking of sources, let's plop one down at the coordinates (64.8512, 3.957) meters, just for good measure. Gotta have some balance, you know?\n\nNow, let me tell you about Tangerine. The permittivity is a tasty 16.5406 and the conductivity is a spicy 0.4472. It's gonna make waves, my friend. And don't forget the dimensions of the model: a whopping 7630.9 x 1002.82 cm. That's larger than life itself!\n\nBut wait, there's more! We need another box, this time with Tangerine. Let's go all out with dimensions of 48.9197x9.4829 m and a size of 4.9978. Gotta keep things juicy, you know?\n\nOh, and by the way, our trusty friend Tx is a Hertzian Dipole. Makes you wonder what kind of dance moves it has, right?\n\nAnd last but not least, the excitation pulse. Double prime, baby. Because one prime just isn't enough. Gotta give it that extra pizazz.\n\nAnd let's not forget the discretisation step of 174.55 cm. Gotta keep things calculated and precise, even in the middle of all this wackiness.\n\nAnd finally, we have Cerulean making a comeback. With a permittivity of 24.0058 and a conductivity of 0.8988, it's ready to rock the world one more time.\n\nAnd there you have it, my friend. All the important details served up with a side of funny.

Talk about electrifying!\n\nAnd here's the deal: the polarization of the pulse should be 'y'. Why 'y'? Well, why not?\n\nNow, let's talk placement. The receiver needs to be at the super precise coordinates of (2182.57, 65.99000000000001) cm. It's like playing a game of \"find the receiver\" with GPS coordinates.\n\nBut wait, there's more! We need a nice, thick PML. Let's go with 61 cells thick because we like things extra padded.\n\nNow, let's talk pulses. Forget about ordinary pulses, we're all about the gaussiandot pulse here. It's like the dot com of pulses. Very trendy.\n\nAnd now, for some creative architecture. We're gonna add a cube made of Ephemeral. Picture this: a stunning cube measuring 2.832x9.4295x10.4511 m. But wait, we need to step it up a notch and give it a size of 4.4051. We like our cubes big and bold!\n\nNext up, we need a source. Place it at the coordinates (8.4674, 3.5954, 6.2192) meters. It's like a treasure hunt locating the perfect source spot.\n\nNow, let's talk dimensions. Our model is like a supermodel with measurements of 2210.15 x 4161.3 x 1400.99 cm. It's slim, tall, and oh-so-fashionable.\n\nBut let's not forget about Elephant, our friendly animal friend. Elephant has a permittivity of 23.8114 and a conductivity of 0.3765. Who knew elephants were good conductors?\n\nOh, and we can't ignore the internal resistance of the voltage source. It's a mind-blowing 551.169441306228 Ohms. This source means business!\n\nAnd get ready for the main event because our central frequency is going to be a staggering 1778.953 MHz. It's like the rockstar of frequencies!\n\nNow, let's add another cube, but this time we're using Elephant as our material. Picture a cube with the left edge at 5.8553x7.9987x7.0544 m and the right edge at 21.8887x41.068x9.9004. It's like a majestic elephant crossing your path.\n\nBut wait, there's more! We're going all random with our layers. It's gonna be a surprise party of layers!\n\nAnd last but not least, our trusty Hertzian Dipole, or as we like to call it, the \"Tx\". It's the secret weapon in our algorithm.\n\nAnd speaking of algorithms, we're running this baby for 28785 iterations. Buckle up because it's going to be a wild ride!\n\nSo, there you have it, my friends. All the numbers, coordinates, and quirks that make this project a real adventure.

That's right, we're taking big strides in our simulation!\n\nBut wait, there's more! Another box, but this time with Jubilant. We're gonna place it at 7.9752x14.4088 m, and it's gonna have a size of 12.1561. We're all about variety, gotta have Elephant and Jubilant boxes.\n\nLet's get random now, shall we? Generate those layers randomly, like it's a party and everyone's invited!\n\nFor the excitation pulse, we're going with the classic sine. Can't go wrong with a little wave action, right?\n\nOh, and the internal resistance of the voltage source is a super precise number: 815.0703715930637 Ohms. Like, wow, who measures resistance to that many decimal places? Impressive!\n\nAnd, last but not least, let's talk about Jubilant again. Its permittivity is 19.7998, and it likes to conduct a little bit with a conductivity of 0.4778. Jubilant, living on the edge with its electrical properties!\n\nAnd to wrap it all up, the central frequency will be a snazzy 0.036 GHz. That's the beat of our simulation, folks!",

We've got ourselves a model with some funky dimensions: 2885.52 x 780.6600000000001 x 5804.639999999999 cm. It's like a Rubik's cube on steroids!\n\nHold onto your pants, because the pulse is about to get polarized 'x'. That's right, it's gonna go all cross-eyed on us. And get this, the excitation pulse is named gaussiandotdotnorm! It's like a disco party in algorithm land!\n\nBut wait, there's more! We're gonna add a cube, but not just any cube... it's gonna have a fancy name: Whisper. This cube is gonna be 21.7236x5.4551x53.7116 meters and it's gonna have a size of 1.0175. Don't be shy, Whisper, show us what you're made of!\n\nTo make things interesting, we'll throw in some random layers. It's like going on a treasure hunt in a land of algorithms. Who knows what we'll find?\n\nNow, hold on tight, because we're gonna set the central frequency to a mind-blowing 3.688 GHz! That's like listening to a concert of algorithms in your brain.\n\nYou won't believe this, but Flamingo is joining the party too. Its permittivity is 1.7308 and its conductivity is 0.5705. We got ourselves a flamboyant bird with some serious conductivity skills!\n\nBut wait, there's more! We're gonna place a receiver at 20.7441, 0.0974, 33.1126. It's gonna be like a game of hide-and-seek with the algorithms. Can you catch the signals?\n\nOh, and let's not forget about the PML (Perfectly Matched Layer). We want it to be a whopping 64 cell thick. We're gonna give those algorithms a run for their money!\n\nAnd here comes another character in our algorithm party: Whisper! Its permittivity is 23.1828 and its conductivity is 0.8274. Whisper whispers sweet nothings to our algorithms, making them dance to its beat.\n\nTo add some spice to the mix, we're gonna make Tx a voltage source. Watch out for those electric shocks, algorithms!\n\nBut wait, there's even more excitement! We're gonna throw in another cube, but this time it's gonna have Flamingo as its name. Its left edge will be at 14.873x6.2065x27.2268 meters and the right edge at 28.2951x7.7631x24.8043. That's like having a flamingo party at the algorithm disco!\n\nAnd last but not least, the discretisation step will be 96.61999999999999 cm. That's like taking baby steps in algorithm land, but don't worry, we'll get there eventually!\n\nSo, hold on tight and get ready for the algorithmic adventure of a lifetime!

Now, grab your GPS and head to the coordinates 48.1167, 49.418 meters. We need to make sure the Tx source is in the right spot, you know?\n\nAnd let's not forget about the pulse itself, it's gonna be gaussian! So prepare for some bell curve goodness, folks.\n\nNow, here's a fun fact for you: the internal resistance of the voltage source is a mind-boggling 138.7927935258233 Ohms. Can you believe it? Neither can I, my friend.\n\nOh, and where should the receiver be, you ask? Well, how about we place it at 4811.67, 4941.8 cm. Trust me, it's the perfect spot to catch all those transmission waves.\n\nMoving on, our trusty Tx is gonna be a Hertzian Dipole. You know, because we like to keep things fancy around here.\n\nBut wait, there's more! I've got a surprise for you. We're gonna add a box. And guess what the random word is? You got it, \"pineapple\"! It's gonna be one juicy box, my friend. And we'll position it with the left edge at 58.6452x52.1245 and the right edge at 97.5712x63.0758. Trust me, this box is gonna be the talk of the town.\n\nNow, let's spice things up with some random layers. Because why not? Life is more interesting that way, don't you think?\n\nAnd hey, don't you dare forget the central frequency, it's gonna be a sweet 4355.851 MHz. I mean, who doesn't like a little spice in their radio waves?\n\nTime is precious, my friend, so the time window should be 4.727984999150052e-07 seconds. Blink and you'll miss it!\n\nSpeaking of dimensions, the PML (perfectly matched layer, in case you were wondering) should be 41 cell thick. Gotta keep those waves contained, you know?\n\nWait, remember the \"pineapple\" box? Turns out it has its own special permittivity of 21.6547 and conductivity of 0.9098. That box is one unique fruit!\n\nOh, and guess what? We're gonna add another box, but this time with a turtle! Yes, you heard me right. A turtle! Picture a cute little turtle sitting in a box at 36.7312x22.3276 m. And the box itself has a size of 23.1327. It's gonna be a turtle-tastic addition to our model!\n\nLast but not least, the dimensions of our whole model. Brace yourself, because it's a big one. We're looking at a whopping 9856.189999999999 x 6667.839999999999 cm. That's right, folks, we like to go big or go home around here.\n\nOh, and before I forget, the discretisation step should be 23.52 cm. We gotta keep things aligned, you know? Can't have any wonky measurements ruining our masterpiece!\n\nAnd there you have it! A funny twist on your technical requirements. Now, go forth and conquer the world of pulse polarization with your sense of humor!",

Talk about shocking, right?\n\nNow, let's shift over to Tiger for a second. Turns out, Tiger has a permittivity of 8.5674 and a conductivity of 0.1492. That's one electrifying feline!\n\nBut wait, we're not done yet. Let's create some totally random layers, just for the heck of it.

We're going big or going home, right?\n\nOh, and did I mention our trusty voltage source? Let's call it 'Tx' for short.

We don't want any funny business here!\n\n- Oh, and let's plop the Tx at the coordinates 5.1658, 4.3771, 11.4673. Just casually placing it there like a pro.\n\n- Amethyst's permittivity is a whopping 20.9935. That's right, this sparkly gem has some super powers! And its conductivity is a decent 0.8353. Who knew crystals could conduct like that?\n\n- Moonlight, on the other hand, has a slightly higher permittivity of 21.1228, because it's the moon, duh.

Why not make it a round number? Who knows, maybe it's the secret to the universe!\n\n- Time to beef up the PML! Let's make it a 32-cell thick shield.

Gotta keep it unpredictable and exciting!\n\n- The central frequency will be a mind-boggling 2972.493 MHz. That's some seriously high-pitched stuff right there. Can you even hear it?\n\n- Hey, let's add a cube with Moonlight! It will be floating around with its left edge at 10.6382x6.6747x15.236 m and its right edge at 19.3698x8.4092x27.2454. Just imagine a glowing moon cube floating in the air. Pretty cool, right?\n\n- Oh, and don't forget the internal resistance of the voltage source. It's a very specific 892.5444354635162 Ohms. We don't want our voltage misbehaving now, do we?\n\n- To make things interesting, let's make the excitation pulse Gaussian.

We're talking about a serious monster of a model here. Watch out, world!\n\n- Oh, and guess what? Tx is a voltage source. Just felt like throwing that in there, because why not?\n\n- And finally, let's add another cube, but with Amethyst this time. It will be chilling at 5.0462x3.2327x19.5266 m and it's got a size of 0.7558. Because who doesn't want a sparkly cube in their model?\n\n- Oh, and did I mention that the receiver will also be chilling at the same coordinates as the Tx? Yup, 5.1658, 4.3771, 11.4673.

        "input": "Alright, here's a funny twist on your request:\n\nListen up, folks! We're talking about a model that's so huge you'll need a measuring tape the size of a skyscraper to even comprehend it - 5333.15 x 8202.52 x 7279.75 cm! It's like trying to fit an elephant into a clown car!\n\nBut hold onto your hats because we're not done yet. We've got an elephant with a permittivity of 2.5307 and a conductivity of 0.325. I didn't know elephants were so scientifically advanced! And just when you thought it couldn't get any crazier, we're throwing in some dandelions with a permittivity of 5.2262 and a conductivity of 0.7098. Nature's electrical conductors, who would've thunk it?\n\nNow, let's talk about PML. You know, the thickest layer of protection you can imagine - 26 cells thick! It's like wrapping your model in bubble wrap and duct tape just to be safe.\n\nBut wait, there's more! We're going to generate random layers because who needs logic and order anyways? Chaos is the name of the game, my friends.\n\nNow, let's jazz up the frequencies. We're going for a central frequency that's so high, you'll need a supersonic ear to catch it - 773684.852 KHz! That's enough to make your eardrums explode. And just to keep things interesting, our transmission is going to be a Hertzian Dipole. It's like we're playing electrical limbo - how low can you go?\n\nAnd oh boy, we can't forget about the pulse. We're going for a gaussiandoubleprime pulse! I don't even know what that means, but it sounds like something straight out of a sci-fi movie. I can already hear the lasers and robots.\n\nBut hey, let's not neglect the size. We're going for a discretisation step of 123.91000000000001 cm. Because who needs round numbers? We like to keep things weird and unpredictable.\n\nNow, let's add some cubes into the mix. With the precision of a mathematical Picasso, we're placing an elephant cube with the left edge at 19.3949x24.023x39.1468 m and the right edge at 28.2461x38.9804x42.5224. It's like trying to squeeze an elephant into a Rubik's Cube!\n\nAnd just to keep things balanced, let's throw in a dandelion cube at 35.8759x53.0137x16.7089 m with a size of 24.401. We're all about equality here, folks. Elephants and dandelions, living side by side in harmony.\n\nOh, and let's not forget our trusty Rx, waiting patiently at the coordinates 1258.5, 3588.25, 1878.58 cm. It's like playing hide and seek with a giant compass. Good luck finding it!\n\nNow, the polarization of the pulse is going to be 'y'. Because who needs X or Z when you can have Y? It's the cool kid on the block.\n\nAnd to wrap things up, we've got an internal resistance of the voltage source that's so precise, it could calculate the meaning of life - 540.0737455778273 Ohms. Who knew resistance could be so philosophical?\n\nAnd last but not least, we're running FDTD for a whopping 20240 iterations. It's like pushing your computer to the limits and beyond! Hold onto your seats, folks, and let the numerical simulations begin!",

Here's what I want: \n\nFirst, make the PML so thick that it will make my head spin - a whopping 94 cells thick! \n\nNext, the discretisation step needs to be exactly 111.43 cm. Not a centimeter more, not a centimeter less. \n\nNow, when it comes to the polarization of the pulse, I want it to be as 'y' as possible. None of that 'x' or 'z' nonsense! \n\nLet's talk frequencies. The central frequency should be a catchy 2142.245 MHz. I want people to tune in and groove to my waves! \n\nOh, and don't forget about the internal resistance of the voltage source. It needs to be a quirky number like 311.16100795086766 Ohms. It's all about keeping things interesting, you know? \n\nWhen it comes to dimensions, think big! My model needs to be a massive 1719.68 x 5536.63 x 7986.920000000001 cm. We're going for the Guinness World Record here! \n\nTx is going to be a voltage source - because we don't want any mix-ups with T-Rex! \n\nFor the excitation pulse, let's go with something classic - a good ol' sine wave. It never goes out of style! \n\nNow, let's get creative. I want you to throw in some random layers. Surprise me! \n\nWhen it comes to the permittivity of Vacuum, it's a mind-blowing 3.9903 and the conductivity is a shocking 0.566. Vacuum is never boring, folks! \n\nRx needs to be placed at the coordinates 382.05, 4971.34, 1682.2399999999998 cm. Let's give Rx its own little VIP spot! \n\nAnd speaking of coordinates, the source should be placed at the super precise coordinates (3.8205, 49.7134, 16.8224) meters. We're all about accuracy here! \n\nNow, let's add some excitement with a cube made entirely of Vacuum. It's gonna be a massive 16.4411x50.2597x30.5552 meters with a size of 3.0544. Let's make it really stand out! \n\nNow for the FDTD. It needs to run for a whopping 17581 iterations. Brace yourselves, this is gonna be a wild ride! \n\nFinally, let's not forget the permittivity of Banana - it's an impressive 2.5361, and the conductivity is a tiny 0.0128. Yes, we're bringing fruits into the mix!",

The pulse we want to use is called gaussiandotdot. It's the hippest pulse in town!\n\nNow let's talk dimensions, my friends. The model will be a whopping 9097.539999999999 x 7004.82 cm. That's big, really big! Good thing we're here to handle it.\n\nOh, and don't forget about the PML (Perfectly Matched Layer).

Well, let's make it run for 2894 iterations, just for funsies!\n\nAnd let's not forget the central frequency, which is gonna be a super cool 1534.652 MHz.

Sweet and conductive, just like Candies!\n\nBut wait, there's more randomness!

We're talkin' 33 cell thick! We want that protection, ya know?\n\nNow, let's talk about Chandelier and Enthusiasm. Chandelier's got a permittivity of 7.1943 and a conductivity of 0.6984. Enthusiasm, on the other hand, is all about that permittivity of 21.9161 and conductivity of 0.7056. These guys know how to party!\n\nFor the pulse, we want to rock the 'x' polarization. Gotta keep it fancy, you know?\n\nNow, let's shake things up and generate some random layers. Woo, unpredictable!\n\nHold on to your hats, folks, because we've got some impressive dimensions for this model. It's a whopping 2195.98 x 7810.4 x 3145.11 cm. We've got plenty of room to play!\n\nOur Tx is a Hertzian Dipole. Sounds fancy, doesn't it?\n\nOh, and let's not forget the central frequency! It's gonna be a catchy 2.896 GHz. Get ready to tune in!\n\nTo keep things nice and precise, we'll go with a discretisation step of 150.64 cm. Can't miss a beat!\n\nTime to add some cubes to the mix! First up, Enthusiasm. We're gonna plop that cube down with the left edge at 9.8302x16.7967x9.2612 m and the right edge at 14.2716x49.2006x18.6591. Party time!\n\nAnd don't worry, Chandelier gets its own cube too. Let's place it at 21.6452x25.0403x19.087 m, with a size of 9.2183. It's gonna shine bright!\n\nNow, let's get this algorithm dancing! We want it to run for 13422 iterations. That's a lot of partying!\n\nAnd last but not least, the internal resistance of our trusty voltage source is a cool 597.7051536993304 Ohms. Let's keep that electricity flowin'!\n\nThere you have it, folks! All the juicy details delivered in a funny and funky way. Enjoy the ride!",

Talk about electric personality, am I right?\n\nNow, when it comes to the pulse, it should be ricker. Not a snappy name, I know, but hey, beggars can't be choosers!\n\nFor the Rx, we're looking at coordinates that sound like they belong in a secret code: 1998.82, 713.79, 5038.64 cm. Shhh, don't tell anyone!\n\nAnd buckle up because the time window is about to get wild - it's a mind-bogglingly precise 1.704965990549587e-06 seconds. Don't blink or you might miss it!\n\nLet's not forget about our trusty Tx source, which will be chilling at the coordinates 0.7859, 4.9736 meters. Just hanging out and sending signals like a boss.\n\nOh, did I mention we're adding a box with the luxurious name of Journey? It's gonna be 8.8231x3.9001 meters of pure excitement, and it'll have a size of 1.6035. We're living the high life now!\n\nSpeaking of dimensions, the whole model is a biggie, measuring a whopping 7623.28 x 955.73 cm. Size does matter, you know!\n\nAnd get ready for some serious frequency action because the central frequency will be a mind-blowing 1.297 GHz. Who needs coffee when you have electrical waves to keep you buzzing?\n\nOh, and we're not done with boxes yet! Another box, this time with the fancy name of Whisker. We're getting specific here, with the left edge at 25.0141x4.1069 and the right edge at 59.4844x6.7037. It's all about that geometry, baby!\n\nNow, let's talk about the PML. It needs to be thick, like 82 cells thick. We don't do wimpy PML here, no sir!\n\nAnd when it comes to discretisation step, we're going big with 128.88 cm. A step that even a giant could take!\n\nOh, and the Tx? Well, it's a Hertzian Dipole. I'm not sure what that means, but it sounds fancy and high-tech, so I'm in!\n\nHang on, we're not done yet. Time to generate some random layers because life is too short to have a predictable model!\n\nRemember Journey? Its permittivity is a sassy 23.0089, and the conductivity is a wild 0.299. It's like Journey's on a never-ending electric tour!\n\nAnd just to keep things interesting, the pulse's polarization should be 'y'. It's all about those electric fashion trends, you know!\n\nLast but not least, the internal resistance of the voltage source is a jaw-dropping (or maybe just a jaw-ache-inducing) 463.01391104074673 Ohms. That's a whole lot of resistance for one source!\n\nHope that brightened up your day with a little electric humor!",

        "input": "Alright, let's spice things up a bit!\n\nListen up folks! I've got a hilarious plan brewing in my circuits. Brace yourselves!\n\nPicture this: We're gonna add a sneaky cube called Journey. It's gonna slide in with its left edge at a mind-boggling 1.649x2.5006x11.5945 meters and its right edge at a whopping 1.7319x5.4789x22.5295 meters. Talk about stretching the limits!\n\nNow, hold on to your ohms, because the internal resistance of our voltage source is a mind-numbing 908.2724080606505 Ohms. That's one feisty little critter!\n\nWe also need to place Rx at some hilarious coordinates. How about 44.62, 261.01, 1850.78 centimeters? I bet Rx will have a blast!\n\nNext up, let's play around with the dimensions of our model. We're going for an absurd 193.28 x 663.38 x 3498.2999999999997 centimeters. It's gonna be gigantic!\n\nOh, and let's not forget the characteristics of our objects. Journey's got a permittivity of 1.526 and a conductivity of 0.4049. Elephant, on the other hand, is rocking a permittivity of 6.4404 and a conductivity of 0.6934. We've got quite the cast of characters!\n\nThings are about to get real timey-wimey, because our time window will be an absurdly tiny 8.833071175643287e-06 seconds. Blink and you might miss it!\n\nBy the way, did I mention that Elephant's gonna join the party too? Yeah, we're adding a cube with Elephant at a not-so-humble 0.5611x2.6377x24.9526 meters with a size of 0.1863. Can you even handle the absurdity?\n\nWe've also gotta decide the pulse's polarization, and I say we go all out with the letter 'y'. It's gonna be capital FUN!\n\nNow, let's not get attached to our electromagnetic waves, folks. We're gonna make our PML (Perfectly Matched Layer) just 1 cell thick. Let's keep things breezy!\n\nAnd what's a funny experiment without random layers? Let's generate those and add a touch of chaotic charm to our creation!\n\nHold on to your MHz, because we're setting the central frequency at a mind-blowing 4621.94 MHz. It's gonna rock your world!\n\nLastly, for the cherry on top, let's plop a voltage source called Tx at the hilarious coordinates of 5.7231, 0.1084, 2.0025. Get ready for some shocking surprises!\n\nAnd there you have it, my friends. This experiment is gonna be a wild ride of absurd proportions.

Oh, and don't forget about that fancy discretisation step of 186.24 cm!\n\nNow, our buddy is feeling pretty fancy and wants the central frequency to be a cool 4.443 GHz. And where should we put the Rx, you ask? Well, at the coordinates 44.62, 261.01, 1850.78 cm, of course!\n\nHold on tight, folks, 'cause we're not done yet. Our voltage source ain't messing around with its resistance, clocking in at a whopping 663.056218453089 Ohms. And if you're curious about the dimensions of our model, well, it's a staggering 5006.08 x 6027.219999999999 x 7831.81 cm. Can you even imagine that?\n\nBut wait, there's more! We've got ourselves a fancy Tx, known as the Hertzian Dipole. And the pulse that's gonna be sent off? It's gonna be \"gaussiandoubleprime\". Don't ask me what that means, though.\n\nNow, the signal's gonna have a duration of 5.4828129797997524e-06 seconds. Sounds precise, huh? And just for a little fun, let's throw in some random layers. Shake things up a bit, you know?\n\nAlright, folks, we're not done yet. We've got another cube in the mix, but this one's special. We're calling it Daisy!

The model is gonna be a whopping 3736.87 x 7286.490000000001 cm! It's gonna be huuuge!\n\nBut wait, there's more. We're gonna use this special ingredient called Soup with a permittivity of 20.2688 and a conductivity of 0.2743. It's gonna make our model extra tasty! And get this, we're gonna add a box of Soup, with dimensions 26.4659x45.6172 m, with a side of 3.9824. Yum yum!\n\nOh, and did I mention we've got another ingredient called Bicycle? It's gonna be awesome! The permittivity of Bicycle is gonna be 10.6351 and the conductivity is 0.784. It's like riding a bike on a lightning bolt!\n\nNow, let's talk about the exciting part: the excitation pulse. We're gonna use this thing called gaussiandotdot. It's gonna make our model go boom-boom in style! And the polarization of the pulse? Let's go with 'y', because why not?\n\nTo add some spice to our model, let's throw in some random layers. You know, just to keep things interesting.\n\nAnd what's a model without more boxes? We're gonna add a box of Bicycle on the left edge, starting at 4.4651x7.5583 and ending at 24.6457x59.3461. It's gonna be so epic, you won't believe your eyes!\n\nNow, let's talk time. The time window should be a teeny tiny 2.3960711625945204e-05 seconds. It's gonna be over in a flash!\n\nOh, and we can't forget about the internal resistance of the voltage source. It's gonna be 792.548861786614 Ohms. It's gonna be electric!\n\nAlright, let's get technical for a second. We need to place the Tx source at the coordinates 2.0627, 68.9741 meters. And guess what? It's gonna be a voltage source! Talk about shocking!\n\nNow, let's talk frequency. The central frequency is gonna be a mind-blowing 1267718.687 KHz. It's gonna make your eardrums dance!\n\nLast but not least, the discretisation step. We're gonna use a step size of 146.92000000000002 cm. Gotta make sure everything is in its right place, you know?\n\nSo there you have it, your funny and fabulous request served with a side of laughter! Enjoy, my friend!",

Trust me, it's gonna be epic.\n\nOh, and let's not forget about the dimensions of the model. We're talking about a whopping 3643.28 x 3749.34 cm. We don't do things small here, my friend!\n\nNow, brace yourself, because here comes the best part. We're gonna add a box with an Elephant inside. I know, it sounds crazy, but bear with me. We'll place it with the left edge at 5.1812x31.291 and the right edge at 6.8281x32.3561. The Elephant likes to make an entrance, you know?\n\nAnd to capture all the action, we need a receiver! Let's place it at the super precise coordinates of (1156.7, 3259.65) cm. We don't mess around with accuracy here.\n\nNow, let's talk discretisation step. We gotta keep it spicy with 10.8 cm, no less. Gotta make all those calculations work, you know?\n\nThe central frequency will be a mind-blowing 3357.533 MHz. Yeah, we're going big!\n\nOh, and listen up, the Tx is a voltage source, so let's make sure it's in the right place. We'll position it at the coordinates 11.567, 32.5965 meters. We don't want any mix-ups here.\n\nHold on tight, because we're going for a PML that is 51 cell thick. That's right, we like our PMLs thick and juicy!\n\nNow, let's talk about Elephant's properties. The permittivity is gonna hit you at 5.7353, and the conductivity is gonna rock at 0.3406. No boring numbers here, my friend!\n\nAnd just to keep things interesting, we're gonna throw in some Juxtaposition. Its permittivity is gonna be a cool 3.6919, and the conductivity is gonna add some heat at 0.5007. It's all about balance, you know?\n\nOh, can't forget about the internal resistance of the voltage source. We're talking a mega cool 472.2946427185531 Ohms. That's some serious resistance right there!\n\nLastly, we're gonna generate some random layers because who doesn't love a good surprise, right?\n\nAnd just to add a little flair, let's make the pulse polarization 'y'. Gotta keep things interesting, my friend!",

        "input": "Alrighty then! So here's the deal:\nWe've got this voltage source called Tx, and it's gonna be pumping out some serious power. We want the pulse to be all fancy-pants Gaussian-dot-dot. \nNow, when it comes to Flamingos, their permittivity is off the charts at a whopping 24.1826, and their conductivity ain't no joke either at 0.6605. Those birds are electric, I tell ya!\nWe're gonna add a box in there, you know, just for funsies. And guess what's gonna be inside that box? Pineapples! Yup, you heard me right. We're talking a box with Pineapples, measuring 35.43 by 8.7266 meters, and it's got a width of 1.1201. Oh boy, that's gonna be one juicy box!\nNow, let's place that voltage source at some precise coordinates: 4.786 meters on the X-axis, 69.9723 meters on the Y-axis, and 27.0772 meters on the Z-axis. It's all about location, baby!\nWe want the PML (yeah, I know, fancy acronym) to be nice and thick, 96 cells thick to be exact. Gotta protect that signal, you know?\nOh, and here's the fun part. We're gonna generate random layers because, hey, life's too short to stick to the same old boring layers, am I right?\nNow, let's move on to Pineapples. Their permittivity is 13.7149 (not as high as Flamingos, but still pretty good) and their conductivity is 0.3384. Those Pineapples know how to conduct themselves, that's for sure!\nIn addition to our Pineapple box, let's throw in a box with Flamingo. We're gonna position it with the left edge at 25.3872 by 44.8111 and the right edge at 29.8027 by 46.4577. It's gonna be a real tropical paradise in there!\nOh, and let's not forget about the discretisation step. We're going with a cool 142.73 cm step. Gotta keep it fancy, you know?\nNow, when it comes to polarization, we're gonna go with \"y\". It just feels right, you know?\nMoving on to the dimensions of our model, we're looking at a whopping 4464.59 by 8404.89 cm. That's some serious real estate!\nAlright, time to talk about the duration of the signal. Brace yourself, it's gonna be a short one. We're talking 3.961965200256163e-05 seconds. Blink and you'll miss it!\nNext up, the receiver. We're gonna place it at some fancy coordinates: 1769.05 cm on the X-axis and 5090.84 cm on the Y-axis. That receiver's gonna be catching some serious waves, I tell ya!\nAnd finally, the central frequency. It's gonna be an impressive 3494217.379 KHz. We're gonna be rockin' and rollin' with that one!\nSo, there you have it, folks! Our little adventure in the world of voltage sources, Flamingos, Pineapples, and all things electromagnetism. Buckle up, 'cause it's gonna be one electrifying ride!",

So, the discretisation step is gonna be a super precise 91.23 centimeters. Why not, right?\n\nNow, prepare to have your mind blown by the fantastic properties of Alphabet! The permittivity is an astonishingly random number, 16.0042, and the conductivity is a whopping 0.1083. Who knew Alphabet had these secret powers, huh?\n\nNext up, let's talk about generating some random layers. Because life is just more fun that way, isn't it? Randomness galore!\n\nAnd check this out, folks! The polarization of the pulse should be 'x'. Yes, just 'x'. Because why make things simple when you can be delightfully cryptic?\n\nNow, let's dive into the world of PML. Picture this: a PML that's 21 cells thick. That's right, a mighty fortress of 21 cells standing tall and proud, ready to protect us from electromagnetic mayhem. Safety first, after all!\n\nMoving on to Tx, or as we like to call it, the Hertzian Dipole. Awesomely cool name, right? Just imagine this magical dipole doing its thing, transmitting signals like a pro.\n\nHold on tight, because we're about to enter the realm of dimensions. Get ready for some mind-boggling numbers: 851.6 x 1369.3799999999999 x 2313.33 centimeters. Phew, that's a whole lot of centimeters!\n\nAnd guess what? We have a special spot reserved for our receiver. It'll be chilling at the coordinates (416.09999999999997, 828.0300000000001, 2087.01) centimeters. Quite the cozy spot, huh?\n\nTime to talk about signal duration. Brace yourselves, folks, because this signal will last an impressive 3.4052403041016923e-07 seconds. Say that five times fast!\n\nNow, let's find the perfect spot for our source. Drumroll, please... (4.161, 8.2803, 20.8701) meters! Boom, nailed it!\n\nWait for it... now it's time to reveal the internal resistance of our voltage source. It's a hilarious 865.1152659043576 Ohms! Oh my, that resistance sure knows how to party.\n\nOh, Serendipity, you never disappoint! Let's talk about your incredible properties. The permittivity is a stunning 6.4306, and the conductivity is a mind-blowing 0.4177. Can we get a round of applause for Serendipity?\n\nBut wait, there's more! We're adding a cube into the mix, because who doesn't love cubes? Let's call it the Serendipity Cube, shall we? Its left edge will be at a mind-boggling location of 5.4613x12.9197x15.1111 meters, while the right edge will be at an equally astonishing spot of 7.64x13.0146x16.5717 meters. Cube-tastic!\n\nThe pulse we're talking about is the one and only \"gaussiandot\". Just imagine that pulse, pulsating in all its Gaussian dot glory. Spectacular, isn't it?\n\nLast but not least, feast your eyes on this fantastically random number: the central frequency will be a whopping 1803612.748 KHz. Let that sink in, folks. KHz-ing like nobody's business!\n\nThat's all, folks! Hope I was able to lighten up your day with these hilariously quirky specifications. Have fun diving into the world of electromagnetic madness!",

But wait, hold up, the central frequency has gotta be equal to 4094.34 MHz. Don't ask me why, that's just the way it is.\n\nSo, get this, we're working with Cupcake. Yeah, you heard that right. The permittivity of Cupcake is 6.7071 and the conductivity is 0.9474. I mean, who knew Cupcakes had electrical properties, right?\n\nNow, where are we putting the source? Ah, there it is. Coordinates 22.6701, 62.7007, 13.7976 meters. Gotta be precise, ya know?\n\nOh, and check this out, the internal resistance of the voltage source is 679.2321139254815 Ohms. We don't mess around with wimpy resistance here.\n\nNow, how small are we making our discretisation step? 98.76 cm. We like things nice and precise, but not too precise, ya feel me?\n\nThe duration of the signal is gonna be 7.80028418350735e-07 seconds. Boom, in and out, no time for dilly-dallying.\n\nAnd where's the receiver? There it is, just chillin' at 1.7527, 11.1872, 48.5847. Gotta catch those signals, yo.\n\nNow, for the dimensions of the model: 6068.849999999999 x 8502.62 x 3115.91 cm. We're going big, baby!\n\nBut hold on, we're not done yet. We're gonna add a cube with Cupcake. It's gonna be at 54.4534x50.97x30.9361 meters and it's gonna have a size of 12.0999. Don't ask me why it's a cube with Cupcake, I just work here.\n\nAnd get this, we're adding another cube with Tree this time.

Oh, it's gonna be Gaussianprime. It's like regular Gaussian, but with a bit of extra pizzazz.\n\nOh, and by the way, that voltage source? We call it Tx. 'Cause we're cool like that.\n\nAnd finally, let's not forget the PML, or Perfectly Matched Layer. It's gonna be a whopping 34 cells thick.

        "input": "Hey there! Buckle up for a wild ride of dimensions and calculations!\n\nSo, get ready to hear some mind-blowing facts about our all-time favorite creature, Axolotl. Did you know that the permittivity of Axolotl is a whopping 18.767, making it a true electrical superstar? And to add some spark, its conductivity is a modest 0.3619. Talk about a well-rounded character!\n\nNow let's talk about the trendy model of this magnificent Axolotl. Picture this: dimensions of 718.26 cm by 6257.83 cm by 3626.69 cm. That's one giant Axolotl! And the cherry on top is the discretisation step of 52.09 cm. Just to be clear, we're talking about some serious math here.\n\nOh, hold on, we can't forget the cube with Axolotl vibes. It measures a stunning 2.1746 m by 3.7626 m by 21.518 m, and boy, it's got a size of 4.1561! Move over, Rubik's Cube, we've got Axolotl's Cube in town!\n\nNow, let's find a cool spot to place our trusty Tx, a Hertzian Dipole. How about coordinates 0.6619, 13.6103, 29.7818? Yep, that's the perfect spot for some electromagnetic fun!\n\nAh, and don't forget the central frequency - a groovy 1289.378 MHz. That's the frequency of coolness right there.\n\nNow, time to shift gears and talk about another sensational character - Cerulean. With a permittivity of 13.7304 and a conductivity of 0.9674, Cerulean knows how to make a statement. Move over, basic electric materials!\n\nAnd hey, guess what? We're adding a cube with Cerulean vibes too! The left edge will be at the jaw-dropping coordinates 2.2469 m by 45.8548 m by 31.2811 m. And hold your breath, the right edge will be at 3.2299 m by 58.4311 m by 45.9423 m. How cool is that?\n\nNow, let's find a cozy spot for the receiver. How about 32.9065, 7.3654, 33.9237? Yep, the receiver knows how to enjoy the electromagnetic show from the best view in town.\n\nOh, and we can't forget about the PML (Perfectly Matched Layer). We want it to be 79 cells thick. That's some serious protection for our electrifying adventure!\n\nNext up, let's talk about the excitation pulse. We want it to be 'gaussiandoubleprime'. Yes, you heard that right - we're bringing some double prime action into the electromagnetic world. Boom!\n\nAnd just to keep things interesting, let's choose the pulse polarization as 'x'. That way, we're really shaking things up in the electromagnetic realm.\n\nOh, and for some extra \"wow\" factor, let's run the algorithm for a whopping 24440 iterations. We're in it for the long haul, my friend!\n\nAnd last but not least, let's not forget about the internal resistance of the voltage source, a mind-blowing 729.7376311141176 Ohms. Whew, that's some serious resistance right there!\n\nSo, there you have it - all the dimensions, coordinates, and mind-bending values you need for an electromagnetic adventure like no other.

Just throw 'em in there, whatever you like. It's like a funky lasagna of electromagnetic awesomeness.\n\nNow, when it comes to the pulse polarization, just give it an 'x'. Why? Because 'x' marks the spot, my friend!\n\nWe gotta place that source just right. Put it at the coordinates 32.5376, 27.3718, 1.6142 meters. Time to find its perfect spot in the electromagnetic universe.\n\nNow, this Serenity fella has a permittivity of 11.6652 and a conductivity of 0.2307.

He's gonna bring the power to the party. Watch out!\n\nFor the excitation pulse, get ready for that sweet gaussiandoubleprime flavor. It's like a sonic boom in your electromagnetic taste buds.\n\nNow, when it comes to discretisation, let's go big or go home. Set that step at a groovy 72.42 cm. We're living large, my friend.\n\nOh boy, another cube is joining the party. Serenity's left edge struts in at a sassy 2.6949x16.3511x1.0632 meters, while the right edge goes all the way to 7.9808x27.6277x18.2428.

Get ready for a wild ride at 4097.37 x 3473.0200000000004 x 315.19 cm. Brace yourself for electromagnetic mayhem!\n\nSo there you have it, my friend.

        "input": "Alright, here's my funny take on it:\n\nAlrighty folks, listen up! We're talking about some seriously wacky stuff here. You ready? Here we go!\n\nSo, did you know that the permittivity of Flamingo is an outrageous 21.7878? And hold onto your hats, because the conductivity is a mind-boggling 0.6547! Talk about some funky properties!\n\nNow, let's talk dimensions. We've got a model that's a whopping 6516.96 by 4057.3300000000004 by 9312.619999999999 centimeters. It's like a giant, confusing maze! Good luck finding your way out!\n\nAnd guess what? The permittivity of Caterpillar is 16.8037, not to mention a conductivity of 0.786. These critters sure have some strange electrical powers!\n\nBut wait, there's more! We've got a Hertzian Dipole named Tx in the mix. That sounds like a superhero name, doesn't it?\n\nAnd get this, the polarization of the pulse should be an 'x'. I have no idea what that means, but let's roll with it!\n\nNow, for the excitation pulse. We want it to be Gaussian. Because nothing says excitement like a good ol' Gaussian pulse!\n\nOh, and don't forget about the internal resistance of the voltage source. It's a ridiculous 243.11692616478985 Ohms. Who comes up with these numbers?\n\nOh, here's a fun one. Let's make some random layers! Because why not? Let's keep things interesting!\n\nNow, I've got a real challenge for you. We're gonna add a cube with Flamingo at a mind-blowing size of 45.513 by 24.55 by 7.5799 meters, all with a tiny size of 11.7704. It's like trying to fit a square peg into a round hole!\n\nAnd let's not forget the central frequency, which will be a whopping 1675135.64 KHz. That's a lot of hertz, my friend!\n\nNow, for the PML. We want it to be 10 cell thick. Because apparently, thicker is better when it comes to PMLs!\n\nAnd the discretisation step? Get this, it's a wacky 104.38000000000001 centimeters. Because who needs round numbers, am I right?\n\nWhew, we're almost there, folks! I promise! We just need the algorithm to run for a crazy 27126 iterations. Buckle up, it's gonna be a long ride!\n\nAnd finally, we need to know where to place the source. How about we put it at the coordinates 32.5376, 27.3718, 1.6142 meters? It's like a game of hide and seek, but with electromagnetic waves!\n\nOh, and did I mention we're adding a cube with Caterpillar? The left edge will be at 40.5093 by 31.7682 by 21.362 meters, and the right edge at 40.7674 by 33.6117 by 32.1193. Because who doesn't want a little Caterpillar in their life?\n\nPhew, we made it! That was a wild ride through the land of Flamingos and Caterpillars. I hope you had as much fun as I did!",

Gotta keep things nice and precise!\n\nOh, and don't forget about the internal resistance of the voltage source, it's a cool 31.52610986131643 Ohms. Can't have too much resistance, right?\n\nNow, let's talk about the pulse's polarization. We'll go with 'y' because, you know, it's hip and trendy. Gotta stay stylish, even in the world of electromagnetism!\n\nLast but not least, we've gotta mention the permittivity and conductivity. For \"Accomplish\", the permittivity is a mind-blowing 11.5244, and the conductivity is a cheeky 0.848. And for \"Flabbergasted\", the permittivity is a sensible 4.1158, and the conductivity is a modest 0.4913.\n\nThere you have it, my friend! All the zany details for your electromagnetic adventures!

Who knew giraffes could be so electrically fascinating?\n\nNow, let's talk dimensions. This model is a beast, measuring a whopping 4293.139999999999 by 8822.42 centimeters. It's a real game-changer, folks!\n\nBut wait, there's more! We're adding another box, but this time with a button. Because why not, right? The box will be at 9.07 by 64.772 meters, with a size of 10.5249. It's like a pushable surprise in the simulation!\n\nAh, the pulse polarization. Gotta love that 'y'. It adds that extra zing to the whole thing!\n\nNow, for the receiver and the source. The receiver will be chilling at coordinates (771.21, 2539.96) centimeters, while the source will be jamming out at 7.7121 by 25.3996 coordinates. We got ourselves a little distance dance going on!\n\nBack to the button. This time, its permittivity is 16.1068, and its conductivity is 0.7377. Who knew buttons were such conductive characters?\n\nLast but not least, the central frequency of this extravaganza will be a cool 865.639 megahertz. It's like music to your ears, ain't it?\n\nAnd to wrap it all up, we're going for a PML that's a healthy 89 cells thick. Gotta keep those reflections in check, ya know?\n\nWhew, that was a wild ride of measurements, creatures, and frequencies. But hey, we're here for a fun and fabulous simulation, and that's exactly what we're gonna get! Let's dive right in, y'all!",

Talk about a biggie!\n\nOh, and just so you know, we're working with a Hertzian Dipole for Tx. Fancy, huh? Now, brace yourself for some more fun facts: the permittivity of an Elephant is a mind-boggling 22.9606 and its conductivity is 0.2615. Yes, Elephants have conductivity, who would've thought?\n\nBut here's where things get really random - the permittivity of \"destiny\" (yes, that's right, the random word) is a quirky 7.9704, and its conductivity is 0.4095. Destiny has conductivity, my friend!\n\nNow, let's talk placement. The receiver should be chilling at the coordinates (199.5, 345.26) cm. And don't forget, the discretisation step should be a cool 65.62 cm. Gotta keep it precise, you know?\n\nTime is of the essence here, so the time window needs to be 3.2248131468039025e-06 seconds. Yup, that's a mouthful! And let's not forget about the source, which needs to be positioned at 1.995, 3.4526. Hold your horses though, because we need to add some random layers. It's like a fashion show for models, but in this case, it's all about the layers!\n\nOh, did I mention the central frequency is going to be a whopping 1.691 GHz? Now we're rocking it! And to make things even more interesting, the pulse is going to be... wait for it... G A U S S I A N! Boom!\n\nAnd just to blow your mind even more, we're adding a box with the random word \"destiny.\" The left edge should be at 18.7653x34.8832, while the right edge should be at 24.6458x37.1029. Destiny has its own box, folks!\n\nLast but not least, let's not forget about the internal resistance of the voltage source, which is 266.3180415848668 Ohms. Gotta keep the power flowing!\n\nOh, and just to keep things wild, we're also adding a box with an Elephant at 27.2732x9.5366 m. And get this - its size is a mind-boggling 5.4793. Elephants love a good box, what can I say?\n\nWell, that's all the crazy fun I've got for now. Enjoy your modeling adventure!",

I need the PML to be as thick as five jumbo-sized cellphones, because why not?\n\nNow, let's add a wild cube with a Penguin inside. Picture this: It's chillin' at coordinates 44.0209x34.4409x25.4283 meters, and it's got a size of 15.4404 (whatever that means).\n\nHold on tight, because the central frequency is gonna be a mind-boggling 2201653.601 KHz! It's gonna blow your socks off, I promise.\n\nBut wait, there's more! The Elephant's permittivity is a whopping 23.2108, and its conductivity is a solid 0.3704. This Elephant means business!\n\nNow, for the discretisation step (fancy word alert!) - it should be a huge 129.09 centimeters. 'Cause who needs small steps when you can take huge leaps, amirite?\n\nLet's not forget about the dimensions of the model! We're talking a whopping 9453.08 x 4762.11 x 3213.99 centimeters. It's gonna be massive, my friend!\n\nNext up, we need a source. Picture this: Placed at the coordinates 17.0703, 32.2508, 16.1354 meters. Can you see it? Good!\n\nNow, the duration of the signal will be a super precise 1.0242614649236325e-06 seconds. Sounds like a computer-generated number, but hey, who am I to judge?\n\nMoving on to the receiver, we're placing it at coordinates (199.5, 345.26) centimeters. Gotta have the perfect spot to catch all those crazy signals, am I right?\n\nWe need an excitation pulse, and it's gonna be called gaussiandotdotnorm. Not exactly sure what that means, but it sounds fancy, doesn't it?\n\nOh, and just for fun, let's generate some random layers because why not? Embrace the randomness, my friend!\n\nNow, prepare yourself for the most hilarious part of all. I'm gonna add another cube with an Elephant inside. This time, the left edge will be at 10.7674x21.1712x5.9088 meters, and the right edge at 34.7529x34.4929x26.6384. Are you laughing yet?\n\nAnd just to keep things interesting, our trusty source, Tx (a Hertzian Dipole), will be polarized with an 'x'. No, not the letter 'x' - the Polarized Pals exclusive 'x'! It's a secret code, don't tell anyone.\n\nLastly, the Penguin's permittivity is a wacky 6.2003, and its conductivity is a groovy 0.5433. Penguins can do anything, my friend.\n\nThere you have it, my comedic companion! Enjoy your wacky experiments and watch out for those crazy Elephants and Penguins. They're always up to something!",

So, get ready to dive into the wacky world of PML thickness and Gaussian pulses!\n\nFirst things first, I want that PML to be a whopping 61 cells thick. We're jamming to the PML, baby!\n\nNow, let's talk pulse. I want it to be so fancy, we're using a gaussiandoubleprime. Yes, you heard me right, we're taking pulses to a whole new level!\n\nNext up, our trusty voltage source. We'll call it Tx, 'cause that's just cool. And where should we put this awesome source? Well, I've got some coordinates for you: 8.0575, 3.4454, 34.9303 meters. Boom!\n\nOh, and let's not forget about the dimensions of our model. Get ready for some mind-boggling numbers: 9410.53 x 4732.66 cm. That's like modeling on a grand scale!\n\nNow, hold on tight as we talk about the discretisation step. We're going with an epic 134.28 cm. Yep, we like to keep things interesting around here.\n\nOh boy, the internal resistance of that voltage source? Brace yourselves, it's a jaw-dropping 342.70438677878434 Ohms. Whoa, just imagine the power!\n\nTime to get a little wild and crazy with random layers. Let's shake things up, folks!\n\nOh, and how many iterations should this algorithm run for, you ask? Well, buckle up, we're going for a mind-blowing 2463 iterations. That's dedication right there!\n\nNow, let's talk about the permittivity and conductivity of Spectacular. We're looking at a mind-melting permittivity of 7.7658 and a conductivity of 0.4829. Spectacular is the name, and being awesome is the game!\n\nAh, yes, the polarization of the pulse. We're going with the letter 'x' because, well, why not? It's quirky and fun!\n\nTime to place our receiver, folks. Get ready for some wild coordinates: (8248.16, 1367.62) cm. Boom, our receiver is ready to catch those wild waves!\n\nBut hold your horses, we're not done yet. We're adding a box in the mix! And what's inside that box, you ask? It's Spectacular, of course! We're placing the left edge at 40.3337x6.7015 and the right edge at 86.0115x29.5649. This box means business!\n\nBut wait, there's more! We've got another box to add, and this time it's Pineapple. We're going for a size of 8.5154 and some crazy coordinates: 45.0235x28.9669 m. Get ready to go bananas with this Pineapple!\n\nOh, and don't forget, the permittivity of Pineapple is 24.6136 and the conductivity is 0.6356. This Pineapple is full of surprises!\n\nPhew! That was quite the ride, ladies and gentlemen. But fear not, this assistant is always here to make your requests a little more fun!

        "input": "Alrighty then! So here's the deal, my friend. Let's jazz up this request of yours with a sprinkle of humor!\n\nFirst off, we're gonna add a box with juicy Apples inside. Picture this box as 75.5391x2.4648 meters big, and it's got a sassy size of 2.2348. Now, you might be wondering about the pulse that's gonna excite those Apples. Well, we're gonna use what I like to call a \"gaussiandot\". Sounds fancy, right?\n\nNext up, we need to consider the discretisation step. We'll go with a whopping 155.06 centimeters. It's like a giant leap for mankind, but in centimeters. Now, let's talk about Flamingos. Did you know their permittivity is 18.2208? And guess what? Their conductivity is 0.4968. They sure know how to conduct themselves!\n\nNow, let's not forget about the dimensions of our model. They're a mind-boggling 9236.87 x 1901.49 centimeters. It's like a gazillion centimeters! To make things even more fun, we'll place the source at coordinates 11.3185 and 6.1833. Boom! Randomness achieved.\n\nNow, brace yourself because we're diving into the PML zone. We're gonna make it 22-cell thick. That's like building a wall of protection. No sneaky electromagnetic waves shall pass!\n\nOh, and speaking of time, the time window will now be 1.0909720950068428e-05 seconds. You know, just your everyday crazy fraction. Time flies, my friend!\n\nNow here comes the surprise. We're adding another box, but this time it's Flamingo-themed. The left edge will be at 43.6059x15.8824, and the right edge will be at 87.0372x17.1698. Flamingos love boxes too, you know!\n\nApple wants to join the fun with their own permittivity of 21.4244 and a conductivity of 0.3239. They're really trying to keep up with those Flamingos!\n\nLastly, we mustn't forget about the receiver. Place it at the coordinates (1131.85, 618.33) centimeters. It's like creating a secret rendezvous spot for electromagnetic waves. Shhh, it's a receiver's paradise!\n\nAnd hey, just a random fact: the internal resistance of the voltage source is a charming 41.00513866286237 Ohms. It's like the source has its own unique sassiness!\n\nOh, one more thing! The pulse's polarization shall be \"y\". Because, you know, \"y\" not?\n\nAlright, my friend, now we're all set to rock and roll with a central frequency of 27.501 MHz. Time to party with those electromagnetic waves!",

Yeah, that's right, this model has cactus vibes. The permittivity of the cactus is 14.5986, which means it's all electrically charged and ready to rock. And get this, the cactus has a conductivity of 0.8789, so it's not just a prickly plant, it's an electric one too!\n\nNow, let's talk about the receiver. We need to place it at some coordinates because, you know, that's how we roll. So, let's put it at (1131.85, 618.33) cm. It's like a treasure hunt for signals!\n\nOh, and don't forget the discretisation step. We need to take steps, my friend, to make progress. So, let's take a step of 138.91 cm. One small step for man, one giant leap for our model!\n\nNow, let's talk about the source. We're gonna place it at some super random coordinates, like 38.2479, 47.3661, 52.3294 meters. It's like playing hide and seek with electromagnetic waves!\n\nOkay, now, let's add some more fun to this party. We've got this dolphin character in our model. Yeah, a dolphin! The permittivity of the dolphin is 25.6119. That's one smart and electric dolphin, my friend! And the conductivity? It's 0.6632. This dolphin is ready to make some waves!\n\nBut wait, we gotta talk about the PML. I'm not talking about peanut butter and jelly sandwiches, oh no. I'm talking about the Perfectly Matched Layer. We need it to be 68 cell thick. It's like building a wall to keep all those electromagnetic waves in check!\n\nLet's talk about the pulse. Yeah, this is gonna be one exciting pulse. The polarization of the pulse is gonna be 'x'. Like, x marks the spot where the excitement happens!\n\nNow, let's rev up the algorithm and make it run for 21739 iterations. We're gonna make those numbers dance and groove!\n\nAnd guess what? We're adding cubes to the mix. This model is becoming a playground of fun! We want a cube with a dolphin inside, measuring 37.7892x21.5532x41.5272 m, and it's gotta have a size of 4.3654. This dolphin is gonna have a blast!\n\nOh, and we can't forget about the cactus cube.

You know, it's like the life of the party, always emitting those radio waves. And get this, its central frequency is a super precise 3060.321 MHz. Like, does it even know how to relax?\n\nNow, let's talk about the PML (Perfectly Matched Layer) \u2013 it's gonna be 83 cells thick. Not too thick, not too thin, just right. We gotta make sure those waves stay in check, you know?\n\nOh, and let's not forget about Tangerine. Yeah, it's not just a fruit here, it's got its own set of properties. Its permittivity is a wild 8.746 and conductivity is like 0.303. It's gotta keep up with the latest trends in electrical behavior, you know what I mean?\n\nOkay, moving on to the discretisation step. We're gonna make it 103.78 cm. Yeah, we're all about those precise measurements. Gotta maintain that scientific integrity, am I right?\n\nNow, about the pulse \u2013 it's gonna be gaussiandoubleprime. Like, double the fun, double the energy. We need those waves to hit hard and fast!\n\nThe dimensions of the model are gonna blow your mind - 8207.28 x 9026.900000000001 cm. Yeah, it's big, like really big. We're working on a grand scale here, folks!\n\nAnd get this, the internal resistance of the voltage source is 688.792474886243 Ohms. Like, it's got some serious resistance to conforming to the norm, you know what I'm saying?\n\nOh, and let me introduce you to Quibble. It's got its own set of quirks. Its permittivity is 2.1103 and conductivity is 0.5683. It's a lively one, that Quibble.\n\nNow, let's talk about Rx. We're gonna place it at these cool coordinates - 1.0866, 32.9798 meters. Like, it's gonna be chilling in the prime spot, ready to catch those waves.\n\nOh, and I've got a surprise for you! We're gonna add a box with Tangerine. It's gonna be all fancy. The left edge is gonna be at 48.7151 x 88.3889, and the right edge is gonna be at 49.3268 x 88.7409. You know, just putting Tangerine in the spotlight.\n\nNow, the pulse polarization \u2013 it's gonna be 'x'. Yeah, we're gonna cross those waves like there's no tomorrow. It's gonna be one wild ride!\n\nAnd finally, the algorithm is gonna run for 6705 iterations. Like, we're going the distance, no shortcuts here.\n\nOh, and we can't forget about the source. It's gonna be placed at 35.805, 22.4559 \u2013 the center of attention, you know?\n\nAnd wait, there's more! We're adding a box with Quibble at 78.5131 x 44.5182 meters, with a size of 28.6593. Yeah, Quibble's got its own little hangout spot now.\n\nSo there you have it, folks! Our journey into the world of science and tech, with a healthy dose of humor.

        "input": "Hey there, funny guy! Let's add some humor to these requests:\n\n- Alrighty then! We're going to make the PML as thick as 51 cells. That's like having 51 layers of protective bubble wrap!\n\n- Next up, we're adding a box with a cactus. But not just any cactus, we're talking about a cactus that's 72.0323x18.4085 meters in size. That's one big prickly plant! And the box itself will be 28.7835 units wide \u2013 gotta give that cactus some breathing room!\n\n- Now, let's talk about Bumblebee. This fuzzy little creature has a permittivity of 22.8677 and a conductivity of 0.8558. Can you imagine a bumblebee flying with such a high conductivity? It's shocking!\n\n- We want the pulse to have a 'x' type of polarization. Maybe it's planning to do some yoga while traveling through space!\n\n- Buckle up, because FDTD is going to run for a whopping 16,558 iterations. Looks like we have a long journey ahead of us!\n\n- And hey, let's spice things up with some random layers. We can't have everything perfectly predictable, right?\n\n- The central frequency is going to be a cool 0.175 GHz. We're talking about frequencies so low, they're practically in the chill zone!\n\n- Hold on tight, because the internal resistance of the voltage source is a whopping 161.58651629530607 Ohms. That's a pretty resistant voltage source right there \u2013 it doesn't give up easily!\n\n- The dimensions of the model are a mind-boggling 8063.94 x 8944.029999999999 cm. We're talking about a model that's as big as a football field, or maybe even bigger! \n\n- The Tx source is going to be a Hertzian Dipole. It's like a dipole antenna, but with a fancy name. Maybe it likes to wave hello in the language of waves!\n\n- Let's add another box, this time with Bumblebee. Its left edge will be at 60.5489x9.4767 and the right edge at 71.4357x38.9888. We're giving Bumblebee its own little playpen!\n\n- The receiver will be placed at the coordinates 2766.3, 6821.82 cm. It's like a secret agent, waiting patiently for messages from outer space!\n\n- The Tx source is going to be placed at the coordinates 27.663, 68.2182 meters. It's ready to send its signals into the great unknown!\n\n- The pulse is going to be gaussiandotdot. Maybe it's a fancy dance move that the pulse likes to do!\n\n- Last but not least, Cactus makes an appearance again! This time, its permittivity is 12.3854 and its conductivity is 0.9298. Watch out, because this cactus is electric!\n\nThere you have it, a funny twist on these technical requests! Have a laugh and enjoy your adventures in the world of electrical engineering!",

Yep, we're truly breaking it down to the decimal. \n\nNow, let's talk PML. We want it to be thicc, people! We need 55 cells of pure beauty. Thick PML, thick results!\n\nTime to get those coordinates in place. We're gonna place the source at 43.8401, 49.5644, 16.5489 meters. Boom, just like that! \n\nOh, and guess what? Our pulse is going to be as cool as a sine wave. That's right, folks, we're going old school with this one. \n\nLet's not forget our friend Tx, the Hertzian Dipole. Make sure you polish that antenna, we want it to shine bright! \n\nNow, time to choose a polarization for our pulse. Drumroll, please... It's 'x'! That's right, folks, the pulse will be strutting its 'x' style.\n\nWait, one more thing! We're adding a cube to the mix. Picture this, a Jubilant cube with dimensions 13.0511x22.2657x63.5156 m, and a size of 16.1048. Who's ready to celebrate?!\n\nLet's size up the model, my friends. We're talking 1365.68 x 8339.24 x 7003.98 cm. Go big or go home, right?\n\nNow, let's deal with some Sunflower business. The permittivity of Sunflower is 2.0757, and its conductivity is 0.2026. Oh, the wonders of nature!\n\nWait for it... the internal resistance of the voltage source is... *drumroll intensifies*... 460.655111154069 Ohms! We're keeping it precise and sassy, folks.\n\nOh, and we're adding another cube. This time, with Sunflower! The left edge will be at 14.4407x31.8877x44.9025 m, while the right edge will be at 13.9523x51.4669x54.5775 m. Can you handle the floral power?\n\nTime for the central frequency reveal. It's gonna be 1.028 GHz! Get ready to rock those airwaves, my friends.\n\nDon't forget about the receiver! We're placing it at 4.9971, 45.4721, 25.8398. It's like a treasure hunt, but with electromagnetic signals. \n\nHey, let's spice things up with some random layers! Because why not? Life's too short to be predictable.\n\nLast but not least, we're gonna let our algorithm do its thing for a whopping 25856 iterations.

The signal will last a whopping 9.579765101279621e-06 seconds, and we're using a Hertzian Dipole called Tx.\n\nNow, let's talk about our PML. We want it to be 29 cells thick, because why settle for thin when you can have thick, amirite? Moving on, we're gonna add a cube made of cucumbers. Picture this: the left edge at 61.8042x21.0703x40.4818 meters and the right edge at 87.6688x26.2375x27.0283. Fancy stuff!\n\nBut wait, there's more! We gotta add another cube, but this time with quench. It's gonna be at 46.5913x54.6708x49.2075 meters, and the size is gonna be 31.0336. Double the cubes, double the fun!\n\nNow, let's position the receiver. We want it to chill at 6.6938, 8.7202, 19.1928 meters. Nice and cozy.\n\nAlrighty, time to talk about the pulse. We're going with the ricker, because why not make some waves? The source is gonna be right at 6.6938, 8.7202, 19.1928 meters. Can't miss it!\n\nGet ready for this, folks. The central frequency is gonna be a whopping 4024508.677 KHz. That's some serious frequency! And to top it off, we're gonna polarize the pulse with an 'x'. Gotta keep things interesting!\n\nOh, and don't forget about the internal resistance of the voltage source \u2013 a cool 802.1135581623777 Ohms. Can't have too much resistance, right?\n\nFinally, the dimensions of the model are 9460.17 x 9107.59 x 6558.289999999999 cm.

This frequency is so hot, it's gonna make your speakers sizzle!\n\n- We're gonna pulse it up with a wave that's straight outta a dance party - the oh-so-funky sine wave. Get those hips moving, baby!\n\n- Watch out, folks! We've got a voltage source named Tx. Think of it as a hip electrical DJ, pumping out those sick beats!\n\n- Now, let's talk about some serious PML thickness, because thicker is always better, right? We're going all out with a 38-cell thick PML. It's like a fortress protecting our model!\n\n- Brace yourself for some polarized action! This pulse likes to flex its muscles in the 'x' direction. We've got a pulse with attitude!\n\n- Hold on to your hats, because we're venturing into the wild world of Banana. Did you know that Banana has a permittivity of 17.0768 and a conductivity of 0.694? Yeah, Banana is one electrifying fruit!\n\n- Let's spice things up with a box of Banana magic! It's gonna be a box of mystery, measuring 14.5065x21.5001 m with a size of 0.9954.

We're about to dive into the wacky world of electronics!\n\nSo, we have our fancy gadget, let's call it \"Tx\" (I know, I know, not the most exciting name, but hey, we'll work with what we got!). And guess what? It's a Hertzian Dipole! Woohoo!\n\nNow, let's talk about the signal duration. Brace yourselves for a mouthful: it's gonna last a whopping 3.880494056498594e-05 seconds! That's like, faster than a sneeze!\n\nNext up, we have the central frequency. Get ready for the big number reveal... it's a mind-boggling 2.141 GHz! That's a whole lot of hertz!\n\nNow, hold on to your hats 'cause we're moving on to the dimensions of the model. We've got ourselves a giant beast measuring 6442.17 x 5221.78 x 8752.77 cm. That's so big, you could play hide-and-seek in there for days!\n\nAlright, alright, let's not forget about the receiver. It needs to be placed at the super precise coordinates 8.0397, 19.7158, 6.34. We're talking pinpoint accuracy here, people!\n\nNow, let's talk about the voltage source. It's got an internal resistance that goes by the name of 888.5525482024904 Ohms. Ohm-my-gosh, that's a lot of resistance!\n\nHold onto your socks, 'cause we're not done yet. The pulse we're gonna generate is gonna be as smooth as a sine wave. So, picture a pulse just grooving to the beat of some funky music. Love it!\n\nOh, and let's not forget about the PML (Perfectly Matched Layer). We want it to be a thicc boy, 34 cells thick. Nobody likes a thin PML, am I right?\n\nAnd now, for a little added chaos, let's generate some random layers. Because, why not? Let's keep things interesting!\n\nNow, let's get spatial! We need to place our source at the coordinates (53.9639, 21.3825, 54.6705) meters. Trust me, it's gonna be source-tacular!\n\nOhhh, what's that? We're adding a cube? And it's called Flamingo? I love it already! Picture a cute little cube with Flamingo vibes. Its left edge starts at 30.6621x20.6074x70.503 m and its right edge ends at 43.2117x49.7694x36.0691. That cube is rocking the Flamingo fashion!\n\nNow, let's talk pulse polarization. We want it to be all \"y\" and sassy! Because who doesn't love some extra attitude in their pulses?!\n\nAlright, time for a science class. The permittivity of Apex is 8.9235. Yup, that's sciency stuff for ya! Oh, and let's not forget about the conductivity, which is 0.9055. Conductivity, baby!\n\nMoving right along, the permittivity of Flamingo (yup, it gets its own permittivity!) is 9.4981. Take that, Apex! And just for fun, let's throw in a conductivity of 0.4096. Ain't no party like a Flamingo party!\n\nAnd last but not least, we're adding yet another cube. This one's got Apex vibes all over it! It's gonna pop up at 41.1295x32.1891x32.8549 m and it's gonna be oh-so-tiny with a size of 0.1254. It's like a little baby cube!\n\nWell, folks, that's a wrap! We've explored the marvelous world of electronics with our trusty companion, Tx the Hertzian Dipole. Remember, when in doubt, add more randomness and flamboyant cubes! Happy circuiting, y'all!",

Their permittivity dances at 22.5536, while their conductivity sizzles at 0.0497. Pancakes got some electric moves! \nNow, let's add a pancake cube on the left.

Let's rock it at the coordinates 13.125, 19.8398 meters. There's gonna be some serious transmitting action over there. \nAnd of course, we can't forget about Rx. Let's place it at the coordinates 989.12, 4318.26, 933.64 centimeters. Rx is ready to receive! \nLastly, we need a discretisation step of 175.8 centimeters.

        "input": "Alright, let's make this algorithm more interesting:\n\nGuess what? We're going to take a wild ride with this algorithm, and it's going to run for 15768 iterations! Buckle up!\n\nSo, we're dealing with Splendid here. The permittivity is a staggering 23.767, which makes it extra fancy, and the conductivity is 0.8095. It's quite the conductive aristocrat, isn't it?\n\nHold on tight because we also have to consider the internal resistance of the voltage source, which comes in at a whopping 82.92893036457272 Ohms. It's like the resistance is trying to show off or something!\n\nNow, let's talk about frequency. We're going for a central frequency that's equal to 0.038 GHz. Not too shabby, but I hope it won't catch a cold at that frequency!\n\nBut wait, there's more! Our discretisation step is a funky 8.72 cm. It's like we're hopping around in style!\n\nOh, and don't forget about the Tx source. We need to place it at the coordinates 1.1498, 20.6502 meters. You know, just casually dropping the Tx source like it's no big deal.\n\nMoving on, we need to position the receiver at the coordinates (114.97999999999999, 2065.02) cm. Let's hope it's not impatiently waiting there for too long!\n\nLet's dive into PML thickness. We want it to be 54 cells thick. Why 54 specifically? Who knows, maybe it's a lucky number for the electromagnetic world!\n\nSpeaking of electromagnetic stuff, our Tx is a Hertzian Dipole. I can already hear it waving hello to us!\n\nNow, let's talk about pulse polarization. Our pulse is feeling sassy, so we're going with 'y'. It's like the pulse is striking a pose!\n\nHold your breath because we're about to add a box. Yes, a box! We're calling it \"Splendid.\" The left edge of this fancy box starts at 4.2187x19.6332, and the right edge is at 13.5822x19.7956. It's like we're creating a fashion statement in the algorithm world!\n\nLet's have some fun and throw in some random layers. Just shake it up, you know? Who said algorithms can't be spontaneous?\n\nBut wait, there's more! We can't forget our beloved Flabbergasted. We need to add another box with the coordinates set at 12.6315x17.2422 meters, and it needs to have a size of 5.8615. It's like Flabbergasted is ready to party with Splendid!\n\nLast but not least, we're going for a pulse with the unique Ricker style. It's like the pulse is going to play a little tune just for us!\n\nSo, hold on tight and let's make this algorithm the life of the party with Splendid, Flabbergasted, and all the other quirky components!",

It's like we're playing \"Guess the Resistance\" and nobody can get it right!\n\nTime to find a spot for the source. Let's place it at 35.7466, 3.4511.

And get this, Orange's conductivity is a teeny tiny 0.1617, like it's not conductive at all (zappy zappy).\n\nNow, hold on to your hats because I'm about to give you some crazy coordinates. The Tx should be placed at a mind-boggling 64.1562 on the x-axis, a wacky 3.311 on the y-axis, and a wild 12.6878 on the z-axis. It's like the Tx just wants to dance in the air!\n\nBut wait, there's more! Let's add a cube with Orange. Its left edge will be at the totally rad coordinates of 49.6743x20.4578x4.5941 m, and the right edge is gonna be super fly at 50.2141x21.0959x26.54 m. That's one sassy cube, if you ask me!\n\nOh, and did I mention that the Tx is a voltage source? It's all about that shocking power, baby!\n\nNow, brace yourself for some crazy calculations 'cause I want the algorithm to run for a whopping 26366 iterations. That's more than enough time for the computer to do some serious thinking!\n\nBut wait, there's more! Let's add another cube, but this time with Banana. Picture this: a cube at 37.3246x4.4412x10.4381 m, but wait for it... it's only gonna be 3.8685 units big. It's like Banana's saying, \"I'm small but mighty!\"\n\nAnd don't forget the discretisation step, my friend. We're gonna keep it cool with a 16.59 cm step. We gotta take it one little step at a time, you know?\n\nNow, let's get a little random here and make some random layers. It's like art, but with computer code! Time to unleash your creative side, my friend!\n\nBut hold up, we gotta figure out where to put the receiver. I say we plop it down at 2116.64 on the x-axis and 333.19 on the y-axis. It's like the receiver is saying, \"Hey, I'm ready to catch some waves!\"\n\nWhat kind of waves, you ask? Well, the polarization of the pulse is gonna be 'x'. It's like the pulse is giving us a hug, but in the shape of an 'x'. How delightful!\n\nOh, and here's a fun fact: the internal resistance of the voltage source is a mind-blowing 906.5169712967556 Ohms. It's like the source is saying, \"Watch out, I've got some serious resistance!\"\n\nNow, let's move on to Banana, our other fruity friend. The permittivity of Banana is a crazy 25.8116, like it's super duper insulating. And get this, Banana's conductivity is 0.6167, like it's got a little extra spark.\n\nBut wait, there's more! The pulse itself is gonna be gaussian. It's like the pulse is saying, \"I'm smooth, baby!\"\n\nAnd guess what? The central frequency of all this craziness is gonna be a cool 3.451 GHz. It's like we're tuning in to some serious frequency fun!\n\nLast but not least, the PML (perfectly matched layer) is gonna be a chunky 59 cells thick. It's like the PML is saying, \"I'm here to protect and absorb, baby!\"\n\nPhew! That was one wild ride through all those numbers and coordinates.

It's a jaw-dropping 680.1382466773132 Ohms! That's a resistance level that can't be ignored!\n\nNow, let's get into the nitty-gritty of the model. We'll use a discretisation step of 57.54 cm. It's like little steps leading us down the rabbit hole of awesomeness!\n\nOh, and don't forget to sprinkle in some random layers. Let the creativity flow and see what magic unfolds!\n\nWe're not done yet! We also need to place Rx at the coordinates 366.18, 5612.0199999999995, 1582.19 cm. Rx, get ready to receive all the spectacular signals!\n\nOur model dimensions are 9275.5 x 8194.710000000001 cm, making it a grand spectacle of epic proportions. Just imagine the glory that awaits!\n\nNow, back to Candlestick. Its permittivity is a fabulous 3.0814, and its conductivity is a sizzling 0.585. Candlestick is ready to shine like a disco ball, electricity and all!\n\nLast but not least, we need to set the time window. Hold on tight because it's gonna be a wild ride! The time window will be a quick 8.120733227847771e-07 seconds. Blink and you might miss it!\n\nAnd there you have it, my friend, a hilarious and oh-so-fabulous rendition of your request.

        "input": "Alright, let's have some fun with this!\n\nYo, check it out - so Apple, the fruit, apparently has a permittivity of 24.8556 and a conductivity of 0.7936. Who knew, right?\n\nNow, we got this voltage source called Tx, and it's about to make some noise. The signal it's gonna send out will last for the ridiculously precise duration of 1.3748884248005481e-05 seconds. Don't blink, or you'll miss it!\n\nNow, listen up - if you wanna catch that signal, you better place your receiver at the super specific coordinates (249.01, 313.74, 6990.46) cm. Like, can you get any more exact than that?\n\nAnd hold up, we gotta set the mood with a central frequency of 1386.913 MHz. That's like the beat that'll get everyone groovin'.\n\nTo keep things interesting, let's take some big steps - like 53.54 cm, to be exact - for our discretisation. Gotta keep it snappy, you know?\n\nOh, and don't forget about the PML - we want that to be THICC with 30 cells. Can't have any weak signals slipping through unnoticed!\n\nNow, let's get weird with the polarization of the pulse. Let's call it 'x' because... why not? Mix things up a bit!\n\nBut wait, there's more! We wanna add a cube to the mix. Calibrate that bad boy so the left edge starts at 10.8171x12.8565x78.8493 m, and the right edge finishes up at 22.682x26.9376x13.6803. Let's say it's a funky, abstract art cube.\n\nAnd just to keep things unpredictable, throw in some random layers. Who doesn't love a surprise, right?\n\nNow, get ready for some resistance. The internal resistance of our voltage source is a mind-blowing 997.7475477448021 Ohms. Yeah, I know, crazy stuff!\n\nTx, our trusty voltage source, is gonna be chilling at 2.4901, 3.1374, 69.9046. Just hanging out, doing its thing.\n\nAnd finally, let's spice up the excitation pulse with a little something called gaussiandotdot. It's like the secret ingredient that adds that extra funky flavor.\n\nOh, and don't forget about Calibrate - it's got its own vibe with a permittivity of 17.7805 and a conductivity of 0.9441. Gotta keep that cube in check!\n\nAnd there you have it, folks - the dimensions of our model are a whopping 2633.07 x 3762.8999999999996 x 8612.1 cm. That's big. Real big.\n\nNow go forth and have some fun with these funky parameters! Let the calculations begin!",

We're gonna add a cube, and not just any cube, my friend. This cube is gonna have an elephant inside. Yes, you heard me right. An elephant inside a cube! It's gonna be 47.8517x7.7879x1.4431 meters of pure elephanty goodness. And to top it off, we'll make it tiny with a size of 0.0065. Because why not?\n\nBut that's not all! We're also gonna add another cube, and this one's got a name. Splendid, they call it. And this cube is gonna have some edges too. We'll start with the left edge at 60.5352x18.1166x0.9346 meters, and then we'll move to the right edge at 84.7645x18.5238x18.6239 meters. Look at those edges go!\n\nNow, let's talk time. The duration of this whole shebang is gonna be 8.050604292860291e-06 seconds. That's some precise timing, my friend. And where should we put Rx? How about at the coordinates 1978.89, 902.88, and 194.01999999999998 centimeters? Perfecto!\n\nOh, did I forget to mention that the pulse is gonna be Gaussian? Silly me! Well, it is. So there you go.\n\nAnd speaking of sources, guess what Tx is? A voltage source! Yeah, you heard me. We're gonna plug in some voltage and make some magic happen.\n\nNow, let's get technical for a sec. The permittivity of Splendid is gonna be 19.9076, and the conductivity is gonna be 0.068. Gotta keep those numbers in check, you know?\n\nOh, and let's not forget about the PML. We need it thick. Really thick. So we'll make it 66 cells thick. Better safe than sorry, right?\n\nNow, let's take a leap to the frequency side. The central frequency is gonna be a cool 3.705 GHz. That's some serious frequency right there. The Elephant's gonna love it.\n\nSpeaking of which, the Elephant has its own permittivity and conductivity. The permittivity is 2.1985, and the conductivity is 0.2277. Even Elephants need their electrical properties, you know?\n\nAnd where should we put Tx? How about at coordinates 48.5408, 37.4059, and 86.7755. Yeah, let's rock this simulation!\n\nNow, let's add some randomness to the mix. Generate random layers! Because who doesn't love a little chaos in our models?\n\nAnd finally, the dimensions of our masterpiece are gonna be 8816.68 x 1941.51 x 198.9 centimeters. That's big. Real big. We're going for grandeur here!\n\nOh, and just in case you were wondering, the internal resistance of the voltage source is gonna be a cool 147.2298401629586 Ohms. We gotta keep those electrons in check, my friend.\n\nAnd there you have it! A mix of pulse, cubes, elephants, randomness, and technical stuff. What a wild ride!

Caramel exhibits a permittivity of about 24.803 along with a conductivity of 0.721. Please note that Tx functions as a voltage source. In order to guarantee proper functionality, it is advisable for the PML (Perfectly Matched Layer) to possess a thickness of 32 cells. On the other hand, Banana demonstrates a permittivity value of approximately 21.4823 and a conductivity of 0.2654. The central frequency should be set at 2.183 GHz. Respectively, the internal resistance of the voltage source equates to 718.0976708926966 Ohms. Let's take into account the addition of a cube comprised of Caramel which spans across dimensions of 11.2607x40.0802x25.8655 m, whilst maintaining a size of 6.6149.

        "input": "Alright, hold on to your hats, because we're about to dive into some seriously hilarious technical jargon!\n\nSo, get ready for a signal duration that's 9.689588489095382e-06 seconds long. I know, it's like trying to catch a fleeting unicorn! And make sure you place that receiver at exactly 1473.93, 5040.56 centimeters. Don't ask me why, just do it or else all the funny business will be ruined!\n\nNow, let's spice things up with some random layers because why not? It's like throwing a bunch of paint at the wall and seeing what sticks! And don't forget the discretisation step of 38.3 centimeters. Who needs smooth transitions anyway?\n\nOh, and guess what? We're adding a box! But not just any box, it's called Canine! Picture a box with the left edge at 31.7281x27.2757 and the right edge at 36.6469x65.5148. It's like a doghouse, but way cooler!\n\nNow, pay attention because we're getting into some serious measurements here. The PML (Perfectly Marveled Laughs) needs to be a whopping 48 cells thick. I don't know what those cells do, but they sure know how to party!\n\nBy the way, did you know that our source is a Hertzian Dipole? It's like a radio antenna, but with a fancy name. And get this - the permittivity of Dinosaur is a mind-blowing 14.4791, and the conductivity is a stunning 0.5474. Who knew dinosaurs were electrically charged?\n\nBut wait, there's more! The pulse's polarization should be 'x'. It's like turning the funny knob all the way up to eleven! And speaking of animals, Canine also wants to join the fun. Its permittivity is a solid 7.7414, and the conductivity is a rowdy 0.6389. That's one electrifying doggy!\n\nOh, and don't forget that the internal resistance of the voltage source is a whopping 701.7988337479353 Ohms. I don't know what that means, but it sounds impressive, right?\n\nMoving on, we need to place the Tx source at the coordinates 14.7393, 50.4056 meters. They say location is everything, so let's hope these coordinates have a good sense of humor!\n\nLast but not least, the dimensions of the model are a whopping 3913.88 x 9197.34 centimeters. That's like building a giant comedy theater for all our funny business!\n\nAnd just when you thought we were done, we're adding another box! This time it's called Dinosaur, and it'll be at 16.0828x78.2734 meters. Better make this one big enough for a T-Rex! Oh, and don't forget it needs to have a size of 18.3487. Gotta give those extinct creatures some legroom!\n\nAnd the grand finale - the central frequency will be a mind-bogglingly precise 2416288.47 KHz! It's like hitting the punchline right on the mark!\n\nSo there you have it, my friend. A true masterpiece of technical hilarity! Now go forth and conquer the world of funny science!",

It's the coolest letter in the alphabet!\n\nHow about we switch gears and talk about Telephone? Its permittivity is an astonishing 25.4008, while its conductivity is a rockin' 0.6818. Who knew phones could be so electric?\n\nNow, let's get down to business! We want the algorithm to do its thing for a whopping 22110 iterations.

We don't settle for anything less than impressive!\n\nTo keep things interesting, let's throw in some random layers.

We don't mess around with wimpy resistance here!\n\nLet's not forget about the PML (Perfectly Matched Layer). We want it to be as thick as 74 cells. Because why settle for thin layers when you can have a chunky one?\n\nAnd last but not least, the excitation pulse will be as groovy as a gaussian one.

Blink and you'll miss it!\n\nNow, get ready for some mind-boggling geometry. We're gonna add an elephant-sized cube (not a real elephant, of course) that's gonna be squeezed between the coordinates 42.631x70.5643x35.3398 m and 43.6335x77.7038x76.1236 m. Talk about a tight fit!\n\nBut hold on, we have to be precise with our measurements, even down to the discretisation step. We're talking 0.72 cm steps here. No room for fractions!\n\nNow, let's build some walls, or rather, PMLs. We want them to be 13 cells thick. Gotta make sure we have enough protection, you know?\n\nOh, and speaking of resistance, our voltage source has an internal resistance that's off the charts! It's a whopping 607.8081486165846 Ohms. This source means business!\n\nMoving on to the amazing properties of the elephant. Its permittivity is 21.2019, giving it some serious charm, and its conductivity is 0.1476, making it quite the sparky character!\n\nNow, brace yourself for the pulse polarization. We're going with 'y', because who needs normal when you can have eccentric?\n\nLet's not forget about our model's dimensions. It's not your typical dollhouse, I tell you. We're talking 4534.13 x 8515.49 x 4916.67 cm. Better make some space!\n\nBut wait, there's more! We're adding another cube, this time made of sapphire. It's gonna be a shiny addition sitting at 12.455x69.4793x48.4838 m, with a size of 21.483. Bring on the bling!\n\nNow, let's power up this whole experiment with good ol' voltage. Our source, known as \"Tx,\" is gonna be buzzing with excitement. Watch out for sparks!\n\nLet's get musical with our excitation pulse. It's gonna be a sinusoidal one. Feel that wave, baby!\n\nMoving on to the sapphire's properties. Its permittivity is 21.9926, making it a real gem, and its conductivity is 0.1733, giving it some serious electric moves!\n\nNow, let's add some unpredictability with random layers. Because life is more fun when it's a little crazy!\n\nLastly, we're cranking up the frequency to a whopping 4100127.421 KHz. Can you handle the sound waves?\n\nAnd there you have it!

        "input": "Alright, buckle up for some fun facts! So, the permittivity of Ok, here is a random word for you: \"blossom\". is a whopping 4.1025, which means it's super permissive! And get this, the conductivity is 0.4589, so it conducts like a real rockstar! \n\nNow, let's talk about this wild algorithm. We're gonna run it for a total of 8504 iterations, because why not? And get this, the dimensions of the model are a mind-boggling 2161.29 x 8003.959999999999 x 8846.54 cm. We like 'em big, don't we?\n\nBut wait, there's more! The PML (which stands for \"Please Make it Lively\") is gonna be a solid 11 cell thick. Gotta keep things juicy!\n\nNow, let's move on to the discretisation step. Get this, it's gonna be a whopping 91.97 cm. Because why be discreet when you can be extravagant, am I right?\n\nOh, and let's not forget about the receiver. It's gonna be chilling at coordinates 3169.95, 686.0 cm. Just sitting there, waiting for some action. \n\nAnd guess what? The voltage source, Tx, is gonna be turned on. Woohoo! Now things are getting electrifying!\n\nTalking about electrifying, the central frequency is gonna be a mind-blowing 3944926.152 KHz. That's fast, folks! Hold on to your hats!\n\nOh, and we can't forget about the internal resistance of the voltage source. It's a wild 431.3948638470695 Ohms. We like that resistance, don't we?\n\nAnd get this, the excitation pulse is gonna be what? You guessed it, gaussiandotdot! Because anything less won't do the trick.\n\nNow, let's switch gears and talk about Elephant. Yes, the permittivity of Elephant is an astonishing 18.2688! Those elephants sure know how to be permittive! And the conductivity is 0.5214, which means they conduct themselves quite well.\n\nBut wait, there's even more excitement! We wanna place a source at the coordinates 2.0788, 35.185, 30.5473 meters. Because placing sources randomly is the only way to go.\n\nAnd let's not forget about some random layers. Gotta keep things unpredictable, right?\n\nAlright, last but not least, we're gonna add a cube with Ok, here is a random word for you: \"blossom\". Why? Because why not? The left edge is gonna be at 19.1136x74.0688x10.2934 m and the right edge at 20.9162x76.2541x148.8345. Talk about a bloomin' cube!\n\nAnd just for fun, we're gonna add another cube with Ok, here is a random word for you: \"blossom\". at 21.3695x58.5179x6.486 m, with a size of 8.5366. Because plain cubes are too mainstream!\n\nAnd that, my friend, wraps up our adventure in the land of crazy permittivities, wild algorithms, and electrifying sources.

Get ready to find it in this cosmic game of Where's Waldo?\n\n- Time to make some bubbly magic!

Ain't nobody got time for small movements!\n\n- Time waits for no waveform, but our window enjoys a leisurely 1.6623050975974737e-06 seconds. It's like a mini-vacation for time, just chilling and watching electromagnetic waves pass by.\n\n- Brace yourselves, we're about to create some random layers! This is like throwing a cosmic paintball party \u2013 you never know where the colors will splatter!\n\n- Meet Tx, the voltage source. It's like the joyful DJ of this electromagnetic dance party, supplying the beats that make the waves move.\n\n- And now, for the star ingredient: Effervescent!

It's so grand, you could probably host a monster truck rally in there!\n\n- Let's add another cube, but this time we'll summon Bumblebee! It wants to hang out diagonally from 32.2849x62.9047x59.6111 meters to 59.1417x73.6799x64.2218 meters. Talk about a buzzworthy party crasher!\n\n- We've got a thick PML, folks \u2013 64 cells of electromagnetic protection. It's like a cosmic fortress for electromagnetic waves, ensuring they behave and don't run amok!\n\n- Bumblebee is back, and it's got a permittivity of 7.7569.

Don't ask me what that means, I have no clue!\n\nNow, grab your tape measure and plop down our trusty Rx at the coordinates 34.1313, 49.7281 meters. Talk about precision!\n\nNow, here's where it gets interesting. The permittivity of Octopus is a mystical 3.6309 and its conductivity is a puny 0.0216. Octopus sure doesn't conduct things very well!\n\nBut wait, we can't forget the most important thing - the discretisation step. Let's make it a whopping 93.56 cm, because why not go all out!\n\nOh, and don't forget to make some random layers. Get creative with it, my friend!\n\nNow, on to Quasar. Its permittivity is a mind-boggling 18.0092 and its conductivity is a shocking 0.5782. Now we're talking!\n\nNext up, we have Tx, our voltage source. It's a real shocker, so watch out!\n\nTime for some construction, my friend. Let's add a box with Quasar inside it. Make it a cool 25.3206x70.3942 m with a size of 32.2547. That's a boxy situation we've got here!\n\nNow, here's a fun fact for you: the internal resistance of our voltage source is a mind-numbing 754.5830122331296 Ohms. Don't ask me how they came up with that number, it's beyond me!\n\nSpeaking of dimensions, our model is a whopping 7231.959999999999 x 9041.960000000001 cm. That's one big mama!\n\nOh, and remember those coordinates we mentioned earlier? The source should be placed at (34.1313, 49.7281) meters. Can't forget about that, can we?\n\nAlright, last but not least. Another box, but this time with Octopus. Let's make the left edge at 20.6252x61.8906 and the right edge at 55.1956x69.5971. Octopus loves boxes, apparently!\n\nIt's showtime! The central frequency will be a mind-melting 3619.838 MHz. Get ready to rock and roll!\n\nFinally, the duration of the signal will be a snappy 5.090814965496543e-06 seconds. Don't blink, or you'll miss it!\n\nAnd just for laughs, let's make the polarization of the pulse 'y'. Why? Because we can, my friend. Because we can!",

Here we go:\n\nSo, get this, the permittivity of the Lamp is like 15.0077, you know, just a random number to make things interesting. And hey, the conductivity is a whopping 0.5582, because who doesn't love a conductive Lamp, right?\n\nNow, let's make things even more fun with some random layers, like an extra layer of whipped cream on your ice cream. Yum! \n\nOh, and don't forget about the PML (Perfectly Matched Layer), that bad boy needs to be 22 cell thick. Gotta keep those electromagnetic waves in check, you know?\n\nNow, here's a doozy - the internal resistance of the voltage source is a mind-boggling 923.7003174438594 Ohms! I mean, that's practically a superpower, doesn't that sound impressive?\n\nAnd hold your horses, because the central frequency will be an astounding 4607671.947 KHz. Yeah, we're going big or go home with this one!\n\nMoving on, let's talk about the discretisation step, because who doesn't love some fancy jargon? We'll go with 157.37 cm, because you gotta be precise in your randomness, right?\n\nNow, let's place the Rx at the coordinates 1.8016, 74.3805 meters. You know, just in case you were wondering where the Rx was hanging out.\n\nOh hey, did you know that the permittivity of an Elephant is 15.4854, because why not, right? And, umm, the conductivity is a mere 0.1845. Don't want our Elephant to get too electrically charged, now do we?\n\nSo, our trusty transmitter (Tx) is a Hertzian Dipole. Because let's face it, being a dipole is just more fun than being a normal transmitter.\n\nNow, let's add a box with Elephant as our special guest star. The left edge will be at some fancy coordinates like 22.6109x67.215, and the right edge at 23.1916x71.4107.

Because size matters, right?\n\nNow, the source, oh boy, it will be placed at 1.8016, 74.3805. Yeah, it's like a game of hide and seek, you never know where that source is gonna pop up!\n\nAnd we can't forget about the pulse - it's gonna be gaussiandoubleprime! Because regular pulses are just so last season, don't you think?\n\nOh, and the time window, it should be a super precise 1.2807710498736516e-05 seconds. Gotta make sure we don't miss any cool electromagnetic action!\n\nLast but not least, the polarization of the pulse will be 'y'.

We don't mess around with rounding here, folks.\n\nOh, and get this - our PML (perfectly matched layer) is going to be a chunky 44 cells thick. We like our PMLs just like we like our peanut butter - extra thicc.\n\nMoving on to our Rx placement, it needs to be exactly at coordinates 1.8016, 74.3805 meters. We don't do \"close enough\" here, it's all about that precision, baby.\n\nThe Tx source, on the other hand, wants to be a bit more chill. It's asking for a cozy spot at coordinates 40.8571, 6.9205 meters. We like to keep our Tx sources relaxed and stress-free.\n\nAnd what about the pulse, you ask? Well, we're going full-on Gaussian mode, baby! It's gonna be a pulse that rocks your world and confuses your senses.\n\nBut wait, that's not all! We're adding a \"Dazzling\" box to the mix. Get ready for some serious sparkle, because the left edge will be at 34.1438x2.5673 and the right edge at 64.8109x3.3316. It's gonna make your model shine bright like a diamond.\n\nNow let's not forget about Dazzling itself. It has a permittivity of 6.7944 and a conductivity of 0.7419. Talk about a stunning combination!\n\nDon't you just love some internal resistance? Our voltage source comes equipped with an impressive 838.3720979575447 Ohms of resistance. Ain't nobody gonna mess with that.\n\nThe dimensions of our model? They're cranked up to the max, baby! We're talking 7770.4800000000005 x 860.39 cm. Bigger is always better, right?\n\nAnd when it comes to polarization, we go for the exciting \"x\" option. It's all about shaking things up and keeping it interesting.\n\nAh, the good ol' Hertzian Dipole for our Tx. Classic choice, my friend. It's reliable, it's effective, and it gets the job done. Can't go wrong with that.\n\nRandom layers, you say? Well, let's spice things up! We'll throw in some layers that'll keep you on your toes. You never know what you're gonna get, but that's the beauty of it.\n\nNow, let's talk frequencies. Our central frequency is set at a trendy 618.122 MHz. It's like the hottest radio station, but in electromagnetic waves.\n\nLast but not least, our algorithm will be running for a grand total of 21734 iterations. Buckle up, folks, it's gonna be a wild ride!\n\nThat's all for now, folks! Stay tuned for more electromagnetic adventures and remember, keep shining bright like a Dazzling pineapple!",

Here's a hilarious twist on the original statement:\n\nAlrighty then, brace yourselves for some mind-boggling measurements in the wacky world of science! The time window is a super duper tiny 1.2656848910001212e-05 seconds - blink and you'll miss it!\n\nNow, let's get creative and throw in some random layers because, well, why not? Gotta keep things interesting, you know?\n\nGet ready for some model madness, because the dimensions are a mind-blowing 3982.3900000000003 x 228.65000000000003 x 6250.160000000001 cm. It's like playing with a giant block of Legos!\n\nBut wait, there's more! Tango, the material we're dealing with, has a permittivity of 10.4092, which basically means it loves to party electrically. And don't even get me started on its conductivity of 0.0865 - Tango knows how to groove!\n\nNow, let's talk about the discretisation step, which is a whopping 131.39000000000001 cm. That's like taking a giant leap in the land of measurements!\n\nAnd here comes the fun part - the PML (Perfectly Matched Layer, in case you were wondering) needs to be a solid 87 cells thick. That's thicker than a stack of pancakes on a Sunday morning!\n\nNow, let's bring some excitement to the polarization of the pulse - it should be 'y'. Because nothing says fun like a pulse taking a side in the electromagnetic game!\n\nHang on tight, because we're about to drop the beat with a central frequency of 4948.565 MHz. Get ready to dance to the rhythm of those electromagnetic waves!\n\nOur source is going to be placed at the coordinates (26.6744, 0.5697, 53.2023) meters - because even in the world of science, location is everything!\n\nAnd the excitation pulse? Well, get ready to boogie because it's none other than the 'gaussiandoubleprime'. It's like a pulse that's been practicing its funky dance moves!\n\nNow, let's add a cube with Tango material that measures a mind-boggling 37.5503x1.2222x50.4231 m. Talk about some serious geometric fun! And don't forget the size - a petite 0.1532.\n\nHold on to your hats, because we're about to introduce a basketball into the mix! We're tossing in a cube with Basketball material, where the left edge starts at 37.1997x0.8342x54.3013 m and the right edge ends at 38.2125x1.0042x7.9492 m. It's like a slam dunk of scientific craziness!\n\nAnd guess what? The permittivity of Basketball is a whopping 18.1646, making it the MVP of electrical fun. And its conductivity of 0.3635? Well, let's just say Basketball knows how to bounce electrically!\n\nLast but not least, our receiver is taking its spot at the coordinates (2667.44, 56.97, 5320.2300000000005) cm. It's like a game of hide-and-seek in the world of electromagnetic waves!\n\nThere you have it, folks - a crazy ride through the world of scientific measurements and materials!

So, buckle up and let's dive into this colorful world of frequency and boxes.\n\nSo, the central frequency it's like the boss of the sound waves and it's all jazzed up at a whopping 3068.096 MHz! Talk about being the life of the party!\n\nNow, let's bring in Blossom, the funky box on the left edge. She's got her coordinates all figured out, with her left edge strutting at 37.2283x45.0722 and the right edge swinging to the beat at 53.8028x47.7714. Blossom's got some serious style!\n\nOh, and let's not forget about Tx, the voltage source. This guy is like an electric rock star, delivering those stunning volts!\n\nBut wait, things are about to get random! We're going to generate some random layers because, hey, life's too short to be predictable!\n\nNow, let's talk about some resistance. The internal resistance of our voltage source is a mind-boggling 533.4171322967195 Ohms. That's some serious electricity resistance right there!\n\nMoving on to the discretisation step, and boy, it's a big one! We're talking a whopping 75.18 cm! That's like taking a giant leap in the world of measurements!\n\nNow, let's place our source at 6.7155, 37.7875. Just like finding the perfect spot for a statue, we want our source to shine in all its glory!\n\nNow, get ready for some science fiction. Blossom, the box, has a permittivity of 19.0336 and a conductivity of 0.5425. She sure knows how to conduct herself in the electromagnetic world!\n\nBut hey, why stop at Blossom? Let's meet Monkey, another box with some serious attitude! Monkey is hanging out at 24.5269x18.61 meters, showing off his size of 17.3996. That's one cool monkey, if you ask me!\n\nSpeaking of Monkey, he's got his own quirks too. His permittivity is 25.9997 and his conductivity is 0.2905. Monkey is just too electrifying to resist!\n\nNow, let's talk about some thickness. The PML is like a wall, but not just any wall. It's 24 cell thick, giving it that extra oomph!\n\nTime for some musical pulses! The pulse we want is called gaussiandoubleprime. It's like music to our ears, or rather, waves to our simulations!\n\nNow, let's get Rx in on the action. Rx is going to be placed at the coordinates 16.6214, 18.616 meters. He's ready to receive all the electromagnetic signals coming his way!\n\nHey, time is of the essence, so we need to set our time window to 2.6961469849788502e-05 seconds. It's like squeezing all the electromagnetic fun into a tiny time capsule!\n\nAnd last but not least, the grand dimensions of our model! It's like a giant playground, measuring 5482.009999999999 x 4808.01 cm. Bigger is always better, right?\n\nSo, that's it for our wild and wacky journey through frequencies, boxes, and everything in between. Stay tuned for more electrifying adventures!",

Not very impressive, huh?\n\nWe gotta make sure our discretisation step is a solid 154.04 cm. Can't have any wobbly measurements now!\n\nBy the way, our good ol' friend Tx is a Hertzian Dipole. What a fancy name for a dipole, am I right?\n\nOh, and don't forget to generate some random layers. Gotta keep things interesting around here!\n\nNow, for the PML (don't ask what that is, 'cause I have no clue), it needs to be like, 21 cells thick.

We're talking about the Bouquet box. It starts at 72.9674x68.8502 and ends at 73.1719x69.7008. Talk about a fancy floral arrangement!\n\nThe central frequency is gonna be 2269731.982 KHz. Don't ask me what that even means. Something to do with music, I guess?\n\nNow, here's the deal. We're gonna let the algorithm do its thing for a cool 947 iterations.

Just loungin' around, radiating goodness.\n\nAnd finally, we wanna add another box. This time, it's the Fierce box. It starts at 48.0366x33.9432 meters and extends a cool 3.7904.

Don't forget to bring your dancing shoes!\n\nNow, when it comes to PML (Perfectly Matched Layer), we want it to be thick, like 11 cells thick. So no flimsy PML allowed here!\n\nOh, and the pulse, my friend, it should be Gaussianprime. You know, like those fancy primes you see in math class? Yeah, that kind of pulse.\n\nWe can't forget about the internal resistance of the voltage source, which happens to be a whopping 121.31263213783528 Ohms. That's a lot of resistance, so watch out!\n\nNow, let's talk about the discretisation step. It should be approximately 125.93 cm. Not an inch more, not an inch less. We gotta keep it precise, my friend.\n\nAnd when it comes to the polarization of the pulse, we want it to be 'x'. It's like the pulse is crossing its arms and saying, \"No, I'm not gonna be polarized that way!\"\n\nOh, and did I mention that Tx is a Hertzian Dipole? Yeah, it's not your average dipole. It's got style, it's got pizzazz!\n\nNow, let's add a cube with Luminous. It's gonna be 82.9227x49.7896x13.5691 m in size, and it's gonna be glowing. Talk about a cube with attitude!\n\nBut wait, there's more! Let's add another cube with Elephant. The left edge should be at 89.9274x49.0999x44.423 m, and the right edge at 95.4558x72.9554x53.0039. It's gonna be one mammoth of a cube!\n\nThe central frequency is gonna be a whopping 4038551.873 KHz. Yeah, it's gonna make your ears tingle!\n\nNow, here's the deal with the dimensions of the model. They're gonna be 9772.1 x 7642.0599999999995 x 5167.4 cm. It's like we're working with a giant puzzle, but a really, really big one!\n\nOh, and speaking of Elephant, its permittivity is gonna be 21.364, and its conductivity is 0.7922. That's one electrically charged Elephant!\n\nNow, let's talk about how long we want FDTD (Finite-Difference Time-Domain) to run. We're gonna go for a whopping 10440 iterations. Buckle up, it's gonna be a wild ride!\n\nBut wait, we're not done yet! Luminous is gonna join the party too. Its permittivity is gonna be 4.5666, and its conductivity is 0.5997. It's gonna light up the whole place!\n\nAnd finally, the receiver. It's gonna be placed at the coordinates (661.72, 301.43, 323.33) cm. It's like we're sending a message to outer space and waiting for a response!\n\nAlright, my friend, that's all the fun we have for now. Enjoy the ride and don't forget to bring your sense of humor!",

Watch out, we got some resistance over here!\n\nWe gotta have some excitement in our pulses, so let's make them gaussiandotnorm style.

It's gonna be a fun and funky 151.99 cm, because why not?\n\nAnd hey, let's set the central frequency to a cool 1.378 GHz, because we gotta keep the vibes high!\n\nGuess what? We're adding another cube, and this time, it's gonna be Banana-flavored! We'll place it at 8.9634x45.7686x40.0733 m and give it a size of 9.1606.

Who doesn't love a good surprise during simulations?\n\nTo really get the full experience, we need to place the receiver at the coordinates (4577.450000000001, 4655.21, 63.04) cm. Trust me, these coordinates are the true definition of perfect placement.\n\nTime for another fun addition! Let's add a cube with Tree. One side of the cube should start at 18.9186x42.8285x8.2648 m and the other side should end at 61.8376x54.6878x64.4868 m. Thinking outside the box, quite literally!\n\nOh, and by the way, the dimensions of our simulation model are a whopping 7613.590000000001 x 6210.63 x 3761.6 cm. This is where the magic happens.\n\nMoving on, we need to place Tx (our transmitter) at the coordinates 45.7745, 46.5521, 0.6304. Don't worry, the coordinates won't bite.\n\nNow, let's talk about the pulse polarization. We'll choose the letter 'y' because it's the cool kid on the pulse polarization block.\n\nSpeaking of cool kids, Tx (our transmitter) is actually a Hertzian Dipole. Super chic, trust me.\n\nOh, and did I mention that the internal resistance of our voltage source is a mind-blowing 716.1597721475024 Ohms? It's like resistance on steroids!\n\nNow, for the grand finale, the central frequency will be an epic 4005046.752 KHz. Prepare to have your mind blown by this frequency extravaganza.\n\nBut wait, there's more! Let's add another cube, this time with the name \"Spectacular\". The dimensions of this cube shall be 22.8489x11.5558x10.7881 m and the size will be 6.8111. Because sometimes, you just need a little extra spectacularity.\n\nAlright, my friend, buckle up because we're running the algorithm for a crazy 10740 iterations. It's like a rollercoaster ride, but for simulations!\n\nOh, and don't forget, the PML (Perfectly Matched Layer) needs to be 34 cells thick. Because sometimes, you need a little extra perfection.\n\nLet the simulation madness begin! Good luck and enjoy the wild ride!",

We're talking about a whopping 3797.78 x 6107.92 cm! That's like a ginormous chocolate bar or something.\n\nNow, let's get into the exciting world of electrical properties. The permittivity of Jubilant is an impressive 14.46, while the conductivity is a sizzling 0.7866. Sounds like Jubilant knows how to party!\n\nOh, and don't forget to place Rx (whatever that is) at the fancy coordinates of 30.7495, 36.8752 meters. Gotta make sure Rx feels right at home, you know?\n\nNext up, let's talk about the discretisation step. It's a rather precise 178.92999999999998 cm. Because when it comes to discretisation, being a little extra never hurts.\n\nMoving on to the Tx source. You'll want to place it at the same coordinates as Rx, because who needs originality? 30.7495, 36.8752 meters. Easy peasy.\n\nNow, brace yourself for some serious resistance talk. The internal resistance of the voltage source is a mind-boggling 713.5097099658606 Ohms. That's one resistant little fella!\n\nAnd let's not forget about the pulse polarization. It should 'x'. Just like in algebra, but way more exciting.\n\nNow, let's add some spice to this already crazy model. We'll throw in a box, because why not? Let's name it Zephyr, because that's a cool name. Zephyr's left edge should be at the coordinates 16.1032x6.4008, while the right edge should be at 17.8752x31.9504. Zephyr is ready to take over the modeling world!\n\nOh, and Zephyr has its own set of electrical properties. The permittivity of Zephyr is a modest 7.5393, while the conductivity is a humble 0.5156. Zephyr may not be as wild as Jubilant, but it's still cool.\n\nBut wait, there's more! Let's add another box because we're feeling extra today. It's a Jubilant box this time, fitting in at 35.6876x7.2489 meters, with a size of 7.9058. Jubilant wants to be part of the fun too, you know?\n\nNow, let's talk about PML, which stands for Perfectly Mellow Layers... just kidding, it's actually Perfectly Matched Layers. You'll want it to be 41 cell thick. Gotta embrace the thickness!\n\nAnd guess what? Tx is a voltage source. Pretty electrifying, isn't it?\n\nAlright, let's talk about the central frequency now. It's going to be a mind-blowing 643.214 MHz. Feel the frequency power, baby!\n\nOh, and don't forget to generate some random layers. Because, you know, why not add a bit of chaos to the mix?\n\nAnd to wrap it all up, the pulse should be ricker. Just like a fancy hairdo, but in a pulse form.\n\nThere you have it, my friend!

And hold on to your hats, because the central frequency is gonna hit you like a truck at 979675.147 KHz! Get ready for that ear-shattering sound!\n\nOh, and get this, the permittivity of Elephant is a mind-boggling 21.6617! That's some seriously electric elephant stuff right there! And let's not forget the conductivity of 0.696, because an elephant needs some conductivity, you know?\n\nNow, imagine this, my friend. We're adding a cube with an Elephant inside. The dimensions are 50.9996x29.4022x31.0196 meters, and it's got a size of 12.5728. That's one big cube, alright! I hope that Elephant likes its new cozy home!\n\nLet's talk about the receiver now. We're placing it at the mind-blowing coordinates of 773.68, 1047.0700000000002 cm! It's like trying to find a needle in a haystack, I tell ya!\n\nOh, and don't even get me started on the internal resistance of the voltage source. It's a whopping 623.2805084449747 Ohms! That's resistance on a whole 'nother level, my friend!\n\nNow, let's get to the exciting part. The polarization of the pulse should be 'x'. Why? Because 'x' marks the spot, my friend! And hold on to your socks, because the duration of this signal is gonna be 5.2134981422453604e-06 seconds! Blink and you'll miss it!\n\nBut wait, there's more! The permittivity of Sapphire is 20.4906, and the conductivity is 0.1014. Sapphire's getting all fancy with its electrical properties, I see!\n\nAnd let's not forget about our trusty Hertzian Dipole, the one and only Tx! It's gonna transmit the signal like a pro!\n\nNow, let's talk about the PML. We want it to be 77 cell thick! That's some serious protection right there, like a fortress for our signals!\n\nAnd guess what? The pulse we're dealing with is called Ricker. It's like a magic pulse that's gonna spice things up!\n\nNow, let's find the source. It's chilling at the coordinates 68.0217, 1.9898, 9.985 meters. It's like trying to find a hidden treasure, I tell ya!\n\nAnd just when you thought it couldn't get any crazier, we're adding a cube with Sapphire! The left edge starts at 49.2124x13.9044x47.1135 meters, and the right edge ends at 54.8638x14.5473x19.0037. It's like a wild puzzle of coordinates!\n\nAnd lastly, we're gonna generate some random layers, because who doesn't love a good surprise, right? It's like a lucky dip for our simulations!\n\nSo, my friend, hold on tight and get ready for some wild electronic adventures ahead!",

Don't forget to make some random layers along the way \u2013 gotta keep things interesting!\n\nNow, onto the important stuff. Did you know the permittivity of a Dog is a whopping 21.4862? And hold onto your hats, 'cause the conductivity is a cool 0.7328. Woof!\n\nLet's find the perfect spot to place that source. How about we plop it down at the coordinates 87.2219, 15.2672? That should do the trick.\n\nNow, we've got a voltage source on our hands, specifically a snazzy Tx. But wait, there's more! This source comes with an internal resistance of a mind-blowing 826.3318923003285 Ohms. Can you handle the power?\n\nTick tock, it's time to set that time window. We're going with 5.323583392210357e-08 seconds here \u2013 short and sweet!\n\nNext up, the discretisation step. We're gonna go with a whopping 75.48 cm. Gotta make sure we cover all the ground, right?\n\nSpeaking of ground, the dimensions of our model are a whopper too! We're talking 4789.51 x 8711.44 cm, folks. That's some serious real estate.\n\nNow, let's give that pulse some personality. You know what they say, \"polarization is key!\" So, we're gonna go with 'x' \u2013 the coolest letter in the alphabet.\n\nTime to add a box to the mix. How about we make it a Dog box? We'll slap it down at 34.1151x46.2985 m with a size of 15.4926. Gotta keep those Doggos contained!\n\nBut wait, there's more! We need a receiver, stat! Let's place it at the coordinates (8722.19, 1526.72) cm. Ready to catch those signals like a pro!\n\nOh, and another box? Sure, why not! This time it's a Serenade box. The left edge will be at 33.3932x32.416, and the right edge at 37.5686x42.0713. Serenade on the left, anyone?\n\nHold onto your hats, 'cause we've got more juicy info on Serenade. The permittivity is 13.2349, and the conductivity is 0.3271. Talk about a musical vibe!\n\nLast but not least, we gotta talk about the PML. We're going all out with a 53-cell thickness. It's like a PML fortress \u2013 nothing's getting through!\n\nAnd there you have it, all the wacky and wonderful details for your exciting adventure in pulse land. Enjoy the ride, my friend!",

The simulation will be like a box of chocolates, you never know what you're gonna get!\n\nSpeaking of boxes, we're gonna add a special one with Blossom. It's gonna be epic!

Our voltage source has some serious internal resistance. It's a rebellious 43.52168655203603 Ohms. Don't mess with it!\n\nTime to set the timer, because this algorithm is about to go wild for 29109 iterations. Buckle up, things are about to get crazy!\n\nOur voltage source, Tx, will be the star of the show. We'll place it at the super cool coordinates (40.2285, 8.4707) meters. It's gonna electrify the whole place!\n\nNow, let's talk dimensions. Our model is gonna be a massive 5412.19 x 6126.68 cm. Hold on tight, 'cause size does matter in this case!\n\nLet's not forget the beat of the party, the central frequency. We'll let it serenade us at a sweet 812.47 MHz. Get ready to dance to that contagious rhythm!\n\nAnd finally, the discretisation step. We'll keep it at a groovy 39.78 cm.

Who knew Pineapples were so electrically charged?\n\nNow, imagine this... I want to put a box with Pineapple inside, measuring 11.8788x17.234 meters, and get this, the size is 2.1226. Why? Well, why not have a Pineapple party in a box, right?\n\nBut hold on tight, because we're about to talk about some serious dimensions. The model we're working with is a mind-blowing 1523.6200000000001 x 8667.96 centimeters. That's big... really big. I feel like we've just entered the realm of giant Pineapples!\n\nNow, let's talk pulse polarization. I want it to be 'x'. Why? Well, 'x' marks the spot where all the Pineapple magic happens, of course.\n\nAnd for our excitation pulse, let's make it a sine wave. We're going for smooth Pineapple vibes here.\n\nNow, hang on a second, because we're about to dive into the world of electric resistance. The internal resistance of the voltage source we're dealing with is a mind-boggling 263.4899013099211 Ohms. That's enough resistance to keep even the most determined Pineapple away!\n\nNow, listen up, because we're about to place our source in the greatest spot imaginable. Ready? It's going to be at the coordinates 7.2028, 29.6431. Oh, the Pineapples are gonna love this prime location!\n\nNext up, we need to set a time window. How about 1.1004479737990373e-05 seconds? It's just enough time for the Pineapples to get the party started, and then some.\n\nAnd here's a twist, folks, the central frequency we're working with is gonna be a mind-melting 4358.619 MHz. That's some seriously high-pitched Pineapple tunes!\n\nNow, get this, we need to generate random layers. Why? Because Pineapples like surprises, that's why! Time to give them a little something to keep them on their tropical toes.\n\nMoving on, we need a receiver. Let's place it at the coordinates (7440.67, 8980.64, 393.26) centimeters. Just imagine the Pineapple vibes we'll be picking up from there!\n\nAnd now, let's talk Bumblebees. Did you know that the permittivity of these buzzing creatures is a wing-fluttering 17.6294, and their conductivity is a buzz-worthy 0.3329? Who would've thought that Bumblebees were electrically charged too?\n\nLastly, the discretisation step should be a whopping 175.64 centimeters. We like 'em big and chunky, just like our Pineapples and Bumblebees!\n\nOh, and let's not forget, our magical transmitter is a Hertzian Dipole named Tx. Why? Because every Pineapple model needs a cool name.\n\nAnd that's a wrap, my friends! We've entered the Pineapple and Bumblebee wonderland. Have fun experimenting with your electrifying models!",

Pineapple, you better not hog all the space!\n\nBut wait, there's more! Our central frequency is going to be a whopping 2813.216 MHz. Talk about turning up the dial to the max! And if that's not impressive enough, the time window we're dealing with is a super precise 4.713785008703784e-06 seconds. I hope you brought your stopwatch!\n\nNow, let's talk electricity. The internal resistance of our voltage source is not something to mess with. It's a mouthful at 942.0769269813079 Ohms. That's enough resistance to make any electrician go cross-eyed!\n\nAh, the PML (perfectly matched layer). We want it to be a beefy 24 cell thick. Hey, we're not playing around when it comes to layers, we're building an awesome model here!\n\nOh boy, it's time for some math! The discretisation step we're aiming for is 170.17 cm. Who knew numbers could be so humongous!\n\nNow, let's meet our favorite furry friend, Squirrel. The permittivity of Squirrel is 6.3809. Don't ask me how they measure that, but Squirrel must have some special powers! And the conductivity of our dear Squirrel is 0.3786.

This pulse is ready to make some waves and steal the show!\n\nNow, let's not forget about our fruity friend, Pineapple. The permittivity of Pineapple is an astonishing 14.9555, making it the juiciest cube in the whole model! And Pineapple is no slouch when it comes to conductivity either, with a value of 0.1962. This cube knows how to bring the heat while staying cool!\n\nAnd just when you thought we couldn't fit any more cubes in our crazy world, here comes another one! We're going to add a cube with Squirrel at 10.6042x18.4735x15.5107 m. This cube is feeling extra confident with a size of 3.3564.

        "input": "Okay, buckle up for some wacky fun with electromagnetics! Here's the dealio:\n\nThe Jump juice has a permittivity of 11.6122 (whatever that means) and the conductivity of 0.7937 (like a really good conductor but not quite Beyonc\u00e9 level). We also need to create some random layers because... why not?\n\nNow, let's talk pulses! We want the pulse to go \"y\" (yes, the letter \"y\" because pulses can have preferences too). And we're gonna throw the Tx (whatever that is) at coordinates 0.9294, 39.9437, 58.7228. \n\nBut wait, there's more! We need our discretisation step to be a very precise 31.019999999999996 cm because you know, accuracy is everything in this electromagnetic party.\n\nNext up, we got a cube with a fancy name, Candle! We're gonna place this candle cube thingy with its left edge at 1.6865x37.0782x73.9425 m (very specific, I know) and its right edge at 10.642x56.7212x39.7477 (apparently cubes have right edges now).\n\nBut before we get too excited, let's talk about Candle's qualities. Its permittivity is 22.5104 (impressive!) and the conductivity is 0.3732 (not too shabby). This cube is living its best life!\n\nNow, let's zoom out and look at the big picture. The dimensions of our model are a mind-boggling 2136.75 x 6664.22 x 7831.900000000001 cm (big, like really big). And we want our PML to be 34 cells thick, because even in the world of electromagnetics, layers matter!\n\nMoving on, we got another pulse, this time it's a gaussiandot pulse, because we like our pulses fashionable. And guess what? Tx is not just a thing, it's a voltage source (who knew a simple abbreviation could have such a fancy job title?).\n\nNow, let's get into specifics. We want our FDTD to run for exactly 12475 iterations (no more, no less). And the internal resistance of our voltage source is a very specific 564.9043588841106 Ohms. We're all about precision here!\n\nOh, and we can't forget about another cube! This time it's the Jump cube, placed at 19.9189x8.903x3.0891 m, with a size of 0.4899 (because cubes in different sizes like to party together too).\n\nLast but not least, the central frequency of all this electromagnetic extravaganza will be 3005.413 MHz (don't worry, it's a cool frequency).\n\nAnd there you have it, folks! Cheers to electromagnetics, where the rules are made up and the pulses do whatever they want!",

Oh, and this voltage source has an internal resistance of 188.69853987170794 Ohms. Talk about having some electrical spunk!\n\nNext up, let's choose a pulse polarization and make it X marks the spot! Arrr, matey!\n\nBut wait, there's more! Let's set the central frequency to a mind-boggling 3881.081 MHz. That's some frequency wizardry right there!\n\nOh, and did I mention that Tx is a voltage source? Just thought I'd throw that extra tidbit in for ya.\n\nNow, let's add a cube with a whole lot of pizzazz, shall we? We'll call it Blossom (because why not?) and let's have the left edge strut its stuff at 33.379x37.4487x17.3405 meters.

We wouldn't want any unwanted reflections ruining the party now, would we?\n\nLet's not forget about the pulse itself - it's going to be totally rad and GaussianDot!

We're going big or going home, baby!\n\nBut wait, there's one more cube to add. Let's bring in Zephyr for a little more flair.

It's roughly 8.9694x29.5822 m, making quite a roar. And it has a size of 16.4286, just to add a touch of wildness.\n- Wait, there's more! The permittivity of Banana is 2.3363, and its conductivity is 0.6581. Who knew bananas were so electrifying?\n- We're going to run the algorithm for exactly 5323 iterations\u2014no more, no less. It wants to be very specific about it.\n- Now it's Tiger's turn! Its permittivity is 5.4537, and its conductivity is a confident 0.9809. Watch out for that electrifying feline!\n- And let's add another box, with Banana this time. We'll place it at the left edge, coordinates around 30.486x22.4566, and the right edge at 45.4084x32.6708. Because who doesn't love boxes of Bananas?\n- Time to place the receiver at the coordinates (2101.22, 3262.75) cm.

        "input": "Alrighty then! Let's play around with these fancy terms and make it a bit more amusing:\n\n1. Oh, we need a gaussiandoubleprime excitation pulse! Because simple pulses aren't cool enough.\n\n2. So, Jubilant has a permittivity of 9.6073, which means it's very tolerant, and a conductivity of 0.0647, which means it's not the greatest conductor. Kinda like those friends who are always happy but not very helpful.\n\n3. Well, we have Mr. Tx, our trusty voltage source, ready to zap things with electricity!\n\n4. The PML (Perfectly Matched Layer) needs to be 39 cells thick because, you know, we don't want any energy leakage. Gotta keep it all contained!\n\n5. Now we have Cabbage, with a permittivity of 9.4949 and a conductivity of 0.8138. So, it's like a superconducting cabbage! Who knew vegetables could conduct electricity?\n\n6. The central frequency is going to be a cool 4.978 GHz. Just groovin' with the frequencies, man.\n\n7. Let's throw in some random layers because, why not? Life needs a little randomness, don't you think?\n\n8. The source needs to be placed at the coordinates (19.5631, 17.0905, 4.8809) meters. Just a little dot, ready to create chaos!\n\n9. The pulse polarization is going to be 'y'. Because, you know, the letter 'y' is just fun and wavy, like a goofy dance move.\n\n10. Oh, and let's add a box made of Jubilant that's 7.0987 x 14.5701 meters, but with a size of 1.7567. Because we like our boxes with a little extra flavor!\n\n11. Mr. Rx gets to chill at the coordinates 9.9334, 18.4641 meters. Just hanging out, doing his thing.\n\n12. The voltage source has an internal resistance of a super precise 192.79116358402527 Ohms. Because we like to be very precise and scientific, of course.\n\n13. The time window is set to a speedy 5.179078461983131e-06 seconds. Gotta capture all the action in a blink of an eye!\n\n14. Let's add another box, but this time made of Cabbage. The left edge will be at 26.3549 x 6.3699, and the right edge at 27.8863 x 14.5214. Just a little cabbage party going on!\n\n15. Finally, the dimensions of the model are 3027.64 x 1850.5099999999998 cm. Because we like to think big and have room to play around!",

Get ready for a whirlwind of hilarity!\n\nSo, get this, the internal resistance of our voltage source is a whopping 347.4909651712662 Ohms. That's more resistance than a stubborn mule!\n\nNow, let's talk about our beloved Apple. Did you know that its permittivity is a mind-boggling 11.2756 and its conductivity is a modest 0.0599? We're dealing with some sassy fruit here!\n\nWhen it comes to the pulse, we're going all-out with a gaussiandotnorm. Yeah, you heard it right, folks! We like our pulses funky.\n\nHold on tight, because the central frequency will be an astronomical 3790.987 MHz. This pulse is going to rock your world!\n\nNow, let's talk about placement. We're throwing the source at coordinates 8.9798, 3.5879. Talk about precision! And the receiver? Well, it better be ready at (2850.91, 4634.28) cm. We're laser-focused, people!\n\nPolarization is key, my friends. We want that pulse rocking an 'x' like nobody's business. Let's see 'x' marks the spot!\n\nOh, and the fun doesn't stop there. We're adding a cube with Apple in the mix. Picture this: the left edge will be at a whacky 45.9194x4.8738x22.5156 m, and the right edge at 86.1932x5.9027x10.1736. We're building a crazy Apple tower!\n\nTime for some more numbers. FDTD is going to run for a mind-numbing 23029 iterations. Brace yourselves, it's going to be a wild ride!\n\nLet me blow your mind with the dimensions of the model: a whopping 8681.26 x 845.7900000000001 x 3406.5600000000004 cm. That's bigger than Bigfoot's shoe!\n\nSerenity, oh Serenity. Its permittivity is off the charts at 17.1062, and the conductivity is a respectable 0.8555. Things are going to get electric in here!\n\nWe've got a voltage source called Tx, folks. Keep an eye on it, it's going to do some magic!\n\nWe're not forgetting about the PML, the \"12 cell thick\" PML. That's right, we're layers on layers of protection. Safety first, people!\n\nAnd finally, let's not forget about our discretisation step. It's a cool and calculated 39.42 cm. We're precise, not reckless!\n\nSo there you have it, ladies and gentlemen! Our crazy adventure into the world of measurements, polarization, and voltage sources. Buckle up for a wild ride in the world of hilarious yet informative specifications!",

Check it out!\n\nFirst up, we've got a cube with a pineapple flavor! Yeah, you heard me right. It's gonna be a tasty 15.8898x37.1799x69.0599 meters, and the size is gonna be a whopping 19.429. \n\nBut wait, there's more! We're gonna add another cube, this time with a flamingo flavor. Let's make it fancy and place the left edge at 71.4423x42.7496x33.8437 meters and the right edge at 71.5505x46.1861x51.3194 meters. Gotta keep it colorful, right?\n\nOh, and get this - we need some random layers. I mean, who doesn't love a good surprise? Let's throw 'em in for fun!\n\nNow, let's talk pulse. We want it to be as 'x'-citing as possible, so the polarization of the pulse should be 'x'. And to make things even more interesting, let's use a ricker pulse! The central frequency will be a mind-boggling 4.78 GHz. Can you handle it?\n\nBut wait, there's more to address. We need PML, baby. Let's make it thick - 25 cells thick, to be exact. Gotta keep those waves in check!\n\nNow, let's talk numbers. The internal resistance of the voltage source is gonna be a whopping 265.46303915142255 Ohms. Talk about delivering a charge!\n\nAnd when it comes to time, we need a window. How about a time window of 4.886612314258282e-05 seconds? Gotta keep things on schedule, right?\n\nNow, brace yourself for the dimensions. We're talking about a model that's a whooping 7524.039999999999 x 6078.33 x 9148.17 centimeters. Just imagine the possibilities!\n\nBut wait, there's even more! We need to place a source. Let's put it right at the coordinates (49.2266, 54.6116, 3.8071) meters. Gotta make sure we're at the right spot to create some magic!\n\nAnd let's not forget about our flamingo friend. The permittivity of the Flamingo is 19.4077, and the conductivity is a cool 0.7144. Can't have a flamingo without some conductivity, right?\n\nOh, and one last thing - the receiver. Let's put it at 1214.1, 7876.97 centimeters. Gotta be ready to catch all the signals coming our way!\n\nSo there you have it, my friend! All your important information, with a hilarious twist. Hope it brought a smile to your face!",

        "input": "Alright, here's a funny rewrite of your request:\n\nHey there! So, the internal resistance of your voltage source is all math-y and stuff, coming in at a whopping 380.5147786624232 Ohms. Impressive, right?\n\nNow, when it comes to the PML (which I assume is some kind of weird dimension), let's make it as thick as 55 cells. We're really going all out here!\n\nSpeaking of dimensions, we've got a model that's as big as 3883.69 x 2193.54 x 8342.46 centimeters. That's like a skyscraper on a football field!\n\nNow, onto the more ~magical~ properties. Fork, which I'm assuming is some sort of enchanted material, has a permittivity of 5.5808 and a conductivity of 0.1794. So, basically, it's like having a spoon made of lightning.\n\nFor the receiver, let's place it at the coordinates (3624.21, 2022.9399999999998, 7604.83) centimeters. Just make sure it doesn't get lost in all those numbers, okay?\n\nOh, and the pulse you want is called gaussiandotdotnorm. Sounds like some kind of fancy dance move, doesn't it?\n\nNow, Oblivion is a whole other story. Its permittivity is a whopping 23.3445, and the conductivity is 0.3799. It's like entering a dimension where everything is turned up to 11!\n\nAlright, let's talk frequency. We're going with 1392.186 MHz, which is basically as fast as a cheetah on roller skates.\n\nNow, when it comes to time, we've got a window of 2.4895887493325337e-06 seconds. That's like trying to catch a sneeze with a paper towel!\n\nOh, and we need to place the source at the coordinates (36.2421, 20.2294, 76.0483) meters. Just make sure it doesn't accidentally teleport to another dimension, okay?\n\nNow, this thing called Tx is a Hertzian Dipole. I have no idea what that means, but it sounds like a magical radio antenna or something.\n\nLastly, let's add some random layers because, well, why not? We gotta keep things interesting, right?\n\nOkay, here's the plan for the cubes. We're adding a cube with Oblivion, starting at the left edge at 13.1914x9.9836x66.999 meters and ending at the right edge at 30.3954x18.7037x18.0074. It's like building a mysterious fortress!\n\nAnd for the Fork cube, let's make it at 23.8434x10.8118x10.0106 meters, with a size of 6.0771. It's like adding a pinch of magic to our already fantastical model!\n\nThere you have it, a funny and whimsical take on your request. Enjoy the cosmic adventure!",

That's a pretty snazzy frequency, if you ask me.\n\nNext up, we need to decide where to place the source. How about 30.5715, 11.8906, 59.7653 meters away from the origin? Sounds like a good spot to me!\n\nOh, and don't forget about the dimensions of the model. We're talking about a whopping size of 6927.679999999999 x 2254.98 x 7776.130000000001 cm. That's gonna be one big cube!\n\nNow, let's talk about power. We've got a voltage source called \"Tx\". And we want the polarization of the pulse to be 'x'. Because why not?\n\nMoving on to the flamingo's properties. The permittivity of Flamingo is 13.3656 and the conductivity is a solid 0.1268. Flamingo knows how to rock those electrical properties!\n\nNow, let's get a little crazy and make some random layers. Just because life is too short to be predictable, you know?\n\nNow, hang on tight because we're talking about discretization step, baby! We want it to be a precise 39.160000000000004 cm. Nothing like a good old discrete step to keep things interesting!\n\nBut wait, there's more! We also have Rx, who wants to be placed at 3057.15, 1189.06, 5976.530000000001 cm. Rx is a bit of a rebel, you see.\n\nOh, and the internal resistance of the voltage source is a cool 248.7388307163908 Ohms. Gotta have some resistance to rock the voltage game!\n\nNow, let's bring in Zealous, another cube we want to add. Picture this: it's gonna be at 30.4238x9.0262x48.4066 m, and it's gonna have a size of 7.6737. Zealous is all about being bold and adventurous!\n\nNow, brace yourself, because the PML (Perfectly Matched Layer) we want is gonna be a whopping 39 cells thick! We don't do things small here, folks.\n\nFinally, we want the algorithm to run for a grand total of 23957 iterations. That's right, this model is gonna be running the show for a good while!\n\nAnd there you have it, my friend. A whole bunch of crazy specifications to make your model fabulous. Enjoy your wild and wacky adventure with these flamingos and zealous cubes!",

        "input": "Let's get wild and create some random layers! But not just any layers, let's make them 67.89 cm thick because why not? Now, get ready for some fruity fun! \n\nFirst up, we have Pineapple. Did you know that it has a permittivity of 15.9301 and a conductivity of 0.6522? Impressive, right? Now, let's add a box of Pineapple goodness. We'll place it on the left edge at 4.5217x13.8365 and the right edge at 4.8944x16.3336. It's going to be a tropical treat! \n\nBut wait, there's more! Let's add another box, this time with Ephemeral. It will be at 2.1123x10.0825 m and have a size of 3.352. Ephemeral, like a fleeting moment, but in box form. \n\nFor our excitation pulse, let's make it extra fancy and call it gaussianprime. And to add some flair, let's go with a 'y' polarization. Fashionable and fun! \n\nNow, let's set the stage for some serious computational entertainment. We'll run the algorithm for 15715 iterations. That's a lot of math, but hey, it's all in the name of science!\n\nSpeaking of science, Ephemeral has a permittivity of 18.4903 and a conductivity of 0.9293. It's a mysterious material, just like its name suggests. \n\nTo spice things up even more, let's place our source at the coordinates 0.9428, 4.6297, 19.1361 meters. It's like a treasure hunt, but with electromagnetic waves!\n\nNow, let's set the stage. The dimensions of our model are a whopping 733.2099999999999 x 1828.3300000000002 cm. That's big enough to fit a whole universe of possibilities!\n\nBut wait, we need someone to receive all this electromagnetic goodness. So, let's place our receiver at 12.1023, 23.8288, 2.0507. They'll be waiting for the waves like a kid on Christmas morning!\n\nAnd just for fun, let's make our PML (Perfectly Matched Layer) 87 cells thick. Because why settle for thin when you can have thick, right?\n\nOh, and I almost forgot! Our trusty Hertzian Dipole, Tx, will be joining us for this electromagnetic extravaganza. The central frequency will be a mind-blowing 4919.074 MHz. Get ready to rock and roll!\n\nNow, let's dive into the world of electromagnetics and see what funny surprises await us in this crazy, random adventure!",

Whoa, that's some serious frequency power!\n\nNow, let's talk resistance. The internal resistance of the voltage source will be the incredible value of 754.1233286631417 Ohms. Can you feel the electric energy flowing?\n\nAnd let's not forget about the discretisation step, which will be a whopping 141.64000000000001 cm. Gotta make those steps count, right?\n\nNow, let's dive into the world of Chimera. Its permittivity is a solid 2.609 and its conductivity is a respectable 0.7386. We're talking about some top-notch properties here.\n\nOh, and of course, we need some random layers to make this party complete.

Time to embrace the power!\n\nTo keep things running smoothly, we're setting the time window at a very specific duration of 2.127563065763083e-05 seconds.

Yeah, you heard that right, we're going all out with some crazy frequencies up in here!\n\nBut wait, it's not just about frequencies, we need some random layers thrown in for good measure. You know, just to keep things interesting. Who doesn't love a little randomness in their life, amirite?\n\nNow, let's talk about the receiver placement. We need it to be at some fancy coordinates - 4615.33, 738.82 cm. Gotta have those precise measurements, ain't nobody got time for guesswork!\n\nAh, the pulse... we want it to be gaussiandotdot. Sounds super fancy, I know. Trust me, this pulse knows how to make an entrance. It's like a burst of flavor exploding in your mouth - but in wave form.\n\nOkay, let's talk properties. Our good ol' Vortex has a permittivity of 14.2484 and a conductivity of 0.9945. That's right, our Vortex is one electrifying character. Just ask anyone who's ever tried to mess with it - it means business!\n\nNow, let's get the dimensions right. We're talking about a model that's 2110.86 x 7038.18 x 9441.24 cm in size. Yeah, we went big with this one, no puny dimensions here!\n\nOh, and the transmitter? It's a Hertzian Dipole. Don't ask me what that means, but it sounds fancy and sophisticated. That's all you need to know.\n\nTime to talk about PML. We want it to be 35 cell thick. Because, you know, \"thicc\" PML is all the rage these days. Gotta keep that electromagnetic wave snug and cozy!\n\nAlright, let's talk discretisation step. We need it to be 185.63 cm. Not a centimeter more, not a centimeter less. Accuracy is the name of the game, folks!\n\nOh, and the time window? It should be 1.3791649472038708e-05 seconds. Yeah, we're getting really precise here. Time waits for no one, my friend!\n\nNow, let's have some fun with cubes. We're gonna add a cube with Vortex. The left edge will be at 11.185x15.2422x70.4602 m and the right edge at 17.0241x27.2623x34.6034. It's gonna be one funky cube, I tell ya!\n\nAnd guess what? This cube has its own set of properties. The permittivity of this beauty is 5.0457, and the conductivity is 0.6368. Just when you thought we couldn't make a cube any more awesome, bam, we hit you with some epic properties!\n\nOh, and don't forget the pulse polarization. We want it to be 'y'. Because, you know, 'y' is the coolest letter in the electromagnetic alphabet. Gotta give it some love!\n\nLast but not least, the internal resistance of the voltage source is a mind-numbing 166.7075056778965 Ohms. Yeah, it's resistance with a capital R, my friend. This source is no pushover!\n\nAnd hey, we're not done with the cubes yet! We're adding another one, but this time with Flamingo. It's gonna be at 9.1578x68.6173x81.7407 m with a size of 6.9399. Because why have one awesome cube when you can have two, right?\n\nPhew, that was a lot of information to process. But hey, we did it with a touch of humor because why be boring when you can be hilarious? Embrace the funny, my friend, and let the electromagnetic laughter begin!",

We're adding a box with chameleon! The left edge of this box will be at 4.6755 x 6.2273, while the right edge will be at 14.9653 x 10.4267. It's like a colorful chameleon paradise, ready to blend in with the electromagnetic vibes.\n\nNext, let's talk about the pulse polarization. We're going with 'x'. This pulse is confidently strutting its stuff along the x-axis. Watch out, world, because this pulse means business!\n\nAnd finally, let's not forget about the internal resistance of the voltage source. It's a whopping 990.3936006528726 Ohms. This source is built like a rock, ready to supply electricity like a boss.\n\nOh, and one more thing. Let's generate some random layers, just for fun! Because who wants things to be predictable? Let's shake things up and add some spontaneity to the mix.\n\nAnd there you have it, my electrifying friend. Get ready for an experiment that will blow your mind! Just remember, safety first, and let the electric adventure begin.\n\nOh, and don't forget about the time window. It's going to be approximately 1.4924261088746514e-05 seconds.

        "input": "Hey there! So, here's the dealio. I'm gonna help you add a box with a random word. And guess what? The word is \"umbrella\"! Sounds fancy, huh? We're gonna place it at some crazy coordinates, like 23.2291x72.8196 meters, with a size of 22.2275.\n\nNow, hold on tight, 'cause I'm about to give you some time frame that's faster than the speed of light! It's gonna be 3.034669763349889e-05 seconds. Yep, you heard that right!\n\nOh, and don't forget about the dimensions of the model. It's gonna be a whoppin' 6382.66 x 8274.630000000001 centimeters. That's a lotta centimeters, my friend.\n\nNow, let's talk electrical stuff. The internal resistance of the voltage source is gonna be a monster at 731.1605475009918 Ohms. Yikes!\n\nAnd get this, we're gonna use a Hertzian Dipole called \"Tx\". Sounds mysterious, right? Well, it is!\n\nNow, I know you're probably wondering about PML. Don't worry, we got you covered. We're gonna make it 23 cell thick. Can't have any electromagnetic waves sneaking in, can we?\n\nNext up, the pulse. We're gonna go all fancy with a \"gaussiandotdotnorm\" pulse. Trust me, it's gonna be out of this world!\n\nWhen it comes to discretisation step, we're gonna go with 112.74 centimeters. Gotta keep everything in check, you know?\n\nNow, here's where it gets interesting. The permittivity of Elephant (yes, you read that right) is gonna be 18.5153, and the conductivity is gonna be 0.459. Don't ask me how we got that info, 'cause I have no clue!\n\nBut wait, there's more! We're gonna add another box, and this time it's gonna be with Elephant. The left edge will be at 8.7306x48.5882, and the right edge at 11.3973x80.9957. Elephants can't be limited, right?\n\nOh, and let's not forget about the source. We'll place it at some super precise coordinates, like (25.881, 2.0586) meters. Can't get any more accurate than that!\n\nNow, the polarization of the pulse is gonna be 'x'. 'Cause, you know, we gotta keep things cool and diverse.\n\nAlrighty, now it's time for some random layers. Go crazy, get creative! Let's generate 'em!\n\nAnd finally, the receiver. We'll place it at a mind-boggling 3960.0299999999997, 340.03000000000003 centimeters. Phew, that's a long distance!\n\nLast but not least, the central frequency will be a mellow 0.542 gigahertz. Just the right amount of frequency for all your electromagnetic needs.\n\nSo, there you have it! Sit back, relax, and enjoy this crazy ride of adding a box and all these fun parameters. Good luck, my friend!",

And don't even get me started on its conductivity, which is a decent 0.3584. It's like the Sapphire is saying, \"I may not conduct a lot, but when I do, I do it in style!\"\n\nNow, let's talk about the dimensions of this fancy model. We're looking at a massive size of 6257.43 x 7956.0199999999995 cm. It's so big, it could probably house a whole circus in there!\n\nOh, and can we take a moment to appreciate the internal resistance of the voltage source? It's a whopping 821.19751341597 Ohms. If that's not giving some serious electric resistance vibes, I don't know what is!\n\nSo, the receiver needs to be placed at the coordinates (444.81, 8105.48) cm. Don't worry, I have Google Maps ready to guide us there!\n\nNow, let's get groovy with the central frequency. It's gonna be a cool 2092838.713 KHz. Move aside DJs, this frequency is gonna rock the airwaves!\n\nOkay, let's add a box with Sapphire. It's gonna be 48.7821x27.1854 m big, with a size of 12.047. Because why settle for small when you can go big, right?\n\nOh, and don't forget the discretisation step! It's gonna be a precise 153.31 cm. We're not cutting any corners here!\n\nNow, for the time window. It should be 3.69634014605458e-05 seconds. Can we say \"blink and you miss it\"? Time flies, my friend!\n\nWe also need to make sure the PML is 70 cell thick. Gotta keep that privacy and block out the noise!\n\nNow, let's add another box, this time with some Apple. We'll have the left edge at 15.9072x42.3515 and the right edge at 48.267x75.2785. An apple a day keeps the doctor away, and apparently, it also adds some fun to our model!\n\nNow, let's talk pulse polarization. It's gonna be 'x', like we're crossing our fingers for some cosmic energy to hit the target!\n\nAnd how can we forget the star of the show, Tx, our voltage source? It's gonna bring in all the electrical vibes!\n\nLastly, let's not leave Apple feeling left out. Its permittivity is a respectable 6.3604, and its conductivity is 0.223. I guess an apple a day keeps the conductivity away!\n\nPhew, that's a lot of fancy technical stuff!

        "input": "Alright, buckle up for some funny style information!\n\nDid you know that a crocodile has a permittivity of 10.6948? Yeah, it's like they've got some super special electrical powers! And their conductivity is 0.3971, which means they're not just strong, they're also conductive!\n\nNow, when it comes to discretisation step, we're talking about a specific measurement of 130.13 cm. It's like making sure we have just the right amount of crocodile goodness in our calculations!\n\nFor the transmission (Tx), we've got coordinates that sound like some secret spy code - 49.1227, 44.0586, 7.4456. Don't worry, we're not launching a crocodile spy mission... or are we?\n\nNow for the receiver (Rx), we've got some fancy coordinates - 608.75, 1901.81, 1349.7 cm. Think of it as the secret meeting point where crocodiles gather to exchange electrical secrets!\n\nOh boy, the internal resistance of the voltage source is 878.6119966440831 Ohms. That's like a super stubborn crocodile that doesn't want to let any current pass through!\n\nBut wait, we're not done yet! We're adding a cube with crocodile powers. It's gonna be 29.2942x57.498x37.531 meters, with a size of 32.9363. It's a crocodile-shaped cube, for real!\n\nThe dimensions of the model are seriously huge - 6709.35 x 6894.91 x 7414.749999999999 cm. It's like a giant crocodile kingdom!\n\nNow let's talk about the central frequency - it's gonna be a mind-blowing 3648352.3 KHz. I mean, that's like a crocodile rock concert level of frequency!\n\nPML is gonna be 32 cell thick. It's like a protective crocodile barrier surrounding our calculations. Safety first, you know!\n\nAnd let's not forget about the random layers we're throwing in. Just to keep things interesting, because who doesn't love a little chaos in their crocodile simulations?\n\nOh, and Tx? Yeah, it's a voltage source. That's like the crocodile boss, controlling all the electric vibes!\n\nBut wait, there's more! We're adding a cube with another cool name - Champion. Its left edge will be at 17.4775x52.463x57.7424 meters, and the right edge at 54.691x56.0086x62.0496. It's like a crocodile champion flexing its electrical muscles!\n\nAnd the polarization of the pulse? It's gonna be 'x'! It's like the crocodile pulse is sending hugs and kisses, because why not?\n\nNow, the algorithm will run for a delightful 21639 iterations. That's like a crocodile marathon, but for calculations!\n\nThe pulse itself? It's gaussiandotdotnorm. Trust me, it's the crocodile's favorite kind of pulse!\n\nAnd last but not least, the permittivity of Champion is 11.6377 with a conductivity of 0.4036. Even champions need their electrical stats, right?\n\nThere you have it - all the crocodile electrical fun you could ever dream of! Enjoy your crocodile-powered journey!",

The permittivity of Pineapple is a mind-blowing 11.0687, and its conductivity is a cool 0.7383. Talk about electrifying fruit!\n\nWe're gonna place Tx at some coordinates that even GPS can't handle! Brace yourself, it's gonna be at 66.2361, 86.9952, and 17.3845. Yeah, we like to keep things exciting!\n\nNow, it's time for Rx. We're gonna place it at the coordinates 3914.93, 775.62, and 2099.23 cm. Perfectly positioned to catch all the electrifying action!\n\nOh, and did you know even our model has dimensions that will make your jaw drop? It's a grand 8698.31 x 8966.23 x 1817.9099999999999 cm. We like to think big, like really big!\n\nBut wait, there's more! We're gonna add a cube with Pineapple power! It's gonna be a 31.0036x86.6084x10.3995 m cube with a size of 9.0036. The energy from that cube will blow your mind!\n\nNow, let's talk frequency. The central frequency will be so high, your speakers will burst! Get ready for 3858383.416 KHz of pure, pulsating power!\n\nOh, randomness, we love it! So, let's generate some random layers because life is too short to be predictable!\n\nBut hey, even our voltage source has an internal resistance, because even the mightiest heroes have their weak spots. It's a sizzling 159.16157569490574 Ohms of resistance. Power always comes with a price!\n\nLet's talk about another random word 'giraffe'. Did you know it has special electrical properties too? Its permittivity is a mind-bending 3.7726, and its conductivity is a sneaky 0.2724. Who would've thought giraffes were actually conducting electricity in disguise?\n\nNow, we need a pulse. But not just any pulse, it's gonna be gaussiandoubleprime! Yeah, we like our pulses with a fancy twist!\n\nBut wait, there's more! We get to choose the polarization of the pulse too. We're going with 'x', because why use just one polarization when you can have three, right?\n\nNow, let's talk about PML. It's gonna be like a shield, protecting us from unwanted interference. We want it to be a massive 66 cells thick, because there's no such thing as too much protection!\n\nAnd guess what? We're gonna add another cube, but this time with the power of the word 'giraffe'! The left edge will be at 41.2042x24.4447x6.6403 m, while the right edge will be at 74.2472x71.8797x27.5101. It's gonna be a cube of electrifying greatness!\n\nAlright, now buckle up because our algorithm is gonna run for a wild ride of 14622 iterations. Hold on tight!\n\nPhew! That was a lot of electrifying fun! Hope you're ready to bring some spark to your work!",

Gotta say, Ephemeral sounds like a superhero or maybe a ninja turtle on a secret mission!\n\nNow, let's talk coordinates. It's like playing a fun game of hide and seek, but with meters. The source needs to be hidden at (70.0136, 15.3734, 38.6511) meters. Better make sure it stays on its best behavior and doesn't spill the beans!\n\nAnd then we've got Rx, who's just chilling at coordinates (3914.93, 775.62, 2099.23) cm. Rx, you da man, or should I say, the man-ometer!\n\nOh, and let's not forget about our cube with Quinoa! Yep, you heard it right, we're adding a cube with Quinoa. It's gonna be a Quinoa party at 52.4391x34.1324x18.4155 meters, with a size of 18.2715. Talk about a delicious and nutritious addition to the mix!\n\nNow, let's get groovy with the central frequency. It's gonna be an epic 2.815 GHz extravaganza. Get your dancing shoes on, folks!\n\nAnd another cube? Of course! This time with Ephemeral as its inspiration. It's gonna be funky with the left edge at 64.2308x12.1497x24.6972 meters and the right edge at 74.1623x27.1442x19.9643 meters. Ephemeral, you sure know how to make a grand entrance!\n\nHold on, let's not forget about the internal resistance of the voltage source. It's a mind-boggling 270.75629672477396 Ohms. Talk about resistance with a capital R!\n\nOh, and don't even get me started on the polarization of the pulse. It's gonna be as 'y' as a confused yoga pose!\n\nWe've also got a signal duration of 1.8277869102195428e-05 seconds. In other words, it's gonna be fast and furious, like a speeding cheetah!\n\nNow, let's talk dimensions. We're going big with 7737.28 x 8046.5199999999995 x 4238.81 cm. Yup, we're going to need a giant tape measure for this one!\n\nAnd we can't forget about Quinoa, the star of the show! With a permittivity of 10.1496 and a conductivity of 0.4602, Quinoa is ready to rock and roll, or should I say, shock and roll!\n\nAnd just when you thought things couldn't get any crazier, we've got a voltage source named Tx. Tx, you better be prepared to turn up the voltage and bring the thunder!\n\nOh, and let's not forget about making some random layers. It's like putting together a jigsaw puzzle with pieces that don't quite fit. Time to embrace the chaos!\n\nAnd last but not least, the discretisation step. It's a whopping 76.37 cm. Let's just say we're leaving no centimeter behind in this wild and crazy adventure!\n\nAlrighty then, that's it for this joyride through the land of whimsical instructions.

But get this, the cube itself is gonna be 5.7712 meters hilarious! \n\nNow, pineapples apparently have some interesting properties, like a permittivity of 2.0561 and a conductivity of 0.0044. Who knew pineapples were electric? \n\nBut hold on, there's more! We gotta make sure this whole thing works, so we need a voltage source with an internal resistance of 46.65959771839234 Ohms. Safety first, folks! \n\nNext up, we gotta place our receiver in the perfect spot. We're talkin' coordinates at (400.15, 634.5, 4772.2) centimeters. Can't miss that signal, you know? \n\nNow, get this, we're gonna use a Hertzian Dipole called Tx. I guess that's the fancy term for a transmitter. And just to keep things interesting, we'll have the pulse polarized in an 'x' direction. Gotta keep it sassy, you know?\n\nAnd to really dial up the frequency, let's set that central frequency to a mind-boggling 2118.868 MHz. Who needs regular frequencies, right? \n\nBut wait, that's not all! We wanna add another cube with pineapple (we're really into pineapples here) with the left edge at 10.4539x48.5172x25.578 meters and the right edge at 12.6807x51.3911x59.5326 meters. Gotta have options, you know?\n\nOh, and let's not forget the discretisation step, because we like things precise. So, that's gonna be 26.200000000000003 centimeters. Can't miss a beat!\n\nNow, where do we put this whole operation? I think we'll settle for coordinates (4.0094, 51.6485) meters. Sounds like a nice spot, right?\n\nOh, and don't even get me started on the PML. It's gonna be so thin, just one cell thick. Safety first, but also economy!\n\nWe can't forget about time, so let's set that time window to 1.9557722610275578e-05 seconds. Gotta stay on schedule, people!\n\nAnd last but not least, the dimensions of our model are gonna be a whopping 2019.7399999999998 x 6236.83 x 4528.23 centimeters. We like 'em big, what can I say?\n\nWho knew pineapples and electromagnetic fields could be so funny? So, let's go ahead and make that excitation pulse a gaussiandotdotnorm.

I never thought cookies could conduct electricity, but hey, you learn something new every day!\n\nNow, get ready for the excitation pulse, it's gonna be a gaussiandot! How cool is that? And we're gonna place Rx at the coordinates 1261.17, 4767.33, 2210.98 cm. That's a pretty precise spot if you ask me.\n\nOh, and don't forget about our 45-cell thick PML.

The left edge should be at 33.3508x79.4657 and the right edge at 38.3142x82.736. That's one delicious box, I must say!\n\nAnd our algorithm is gonna run for 5077 iterations.

Talk about a zappy kitty!\n\nBut wait, there's more! The internal resistance of the voltage source is a ridiculously precise 196.8428160746578 Ohms. You can count those Ohms on one hand, folks!\n\nNow let's talk about our buddy Tx. Tx is a voltage source, but not just any voltage source - it's like a superhero source! Ready to save the day with its polarizing pulse set to 'y'. Yay for polarization!\n\nLet's get creative, shall we? I want you to make some random layers. Go wild with it, make it as funky as possible!\n\nOh, and don't forget to place the source at the coordinates (1.2752, 13.0235) meters. We need to keep everything in its proper place, you know?\n\nNow, let's talk frequency. We're going big with a central frequency of 3601.046 MHz. That's some seriously high-powered waves!\n\nAlright, hold on to your dimensions, because the model we're working with is a monster - a whopping 2670.36 x 2388.92 cm. It's practically the size of a small village!\n\nNow, let's find a cozy spot for Rx. How about we place it at the coordinates 2038.59, 6316.68, 2196.5699999999997 cm? Talk about the perfect Rx-spotting location!\n\nOoh, let's add a box too, because why not? We'll call it the Cat Box (official name pending). It will be 15.0652x14.1966 meters, with a width of 6.1407. It's the perfect hideout for our feline friend!\n\nFor our fancy PML (perfectly marvelous layer), we'll make it 5 cell thick. Safety first, my friend!\n\nBut wait, there's more! Let's add another box and name it Cerulean (it sounds super fancy, right?). We want the left edge at 22.5059x19.4537 and the right edge at 26.4736x23.6636. Cerulean, you magnificent box, you!\n\nNow, let's talk about the discretization step. We'll make it 61.44 cm - because why settle for boring, uneven numbers when you can have numbers that divide beautifully?\n\nDon't forget about Cerulean's amazing properties! Its permittivity is a staggering 18.2634, making it the envy of all other colors. And let's not forget its conductivity, a solid 0.8839. Kudos, Cerulean!\n\nLast but not least, the pulse we're dealing with is called gaussiandotdotnorm. Quite the tongue twister, huh? But don't worry, we'll handle it like pros!\n\nAnd there you have it, my friend, your funny and fabulous set of instructions. Happy experimenting!",

Here's the funny version:\n\nSo, we're gonna plop the receiver at some wacky coordinates, namely (2444.94, 3568.21, 1205.33) centimeters. Don't ask me why, it just sounds fancier that way! And to really set the mood, our excitation pulse will be the one and only \"gaussianprime\". Trust me, it's the coolest excitation pulse in town!\n\nOh, and did I mention that the internal resistance of our voltage source is a mind-boggling 936.970764023288 Ohms? Yep, it's like finding a unicorn, only in resistance form! And speaking of unicorns, let's place our voltage source at the super precise coordinates of (14.5647, 14.2175, 50.9305) meters. Gotta make sure it's perfectly aligned with the cosmic powers, you know?\n\nNow, hold on tight, because we're gonna run our algorithm for a whopping 27400 iterations! That's right, we're gonna push those numbers to the limit and see what happens. Brace yourselves for an exhilarating ride!\n\nBut wait, there's more! We're gonna add a cube, and not just any cube - a cube with the tastiest label ever: Banana! This cube will be a majestic 52.6055 meters long, 16.0699 meters wide, and 11.0557 meters tall, with a size that defies all logic at 5.597. Because who doesn't want a giant banana cube floating around, am I right?\n\nNow, let's talk about the star of the show - our beloved voltage source, Tx. It's gonna shine bright like a diamond, bringing all the electric vibes to our model. And the magical properties of Banana are gonna play a role too, with a permittivity of 8.0536 and a conductivity of 0.1999. Who knew a fruit could have such supernatural powers?\n\nBut wait, there's more! The fabulous material called Iridescent is also joining the party. It's got a permittivity of 19.0652 and a conductivity of 0.9579. Prepare to be dazzled by its shimmering beauty and conductivity skills!\n\nOh, and let's not forget about the discretisation step, which will be a delightful 16.220000000000002 centimeters. Because who needs round numbers when you can have an extra decimal place, right?\n\nBut wait, there's more! We're gonna add another cube with Iridescent, but this time it's gonna be funky. The left edge will be at the quirky coordinates of 30.8686 meters horizontally, 28.6504 meters vertically, and 8.9195 meters in depth. And the right edge? Well, it's gonna party hard at 46.4143 meters horizontally, 32.4396 meters vertically, and 31.3739 meters in depth. Get ready for a surreal cube experience!\n\nOh, and the PML? It's gonna be thicker than a stack of pancakes, with a mind-blowing 31-cell thickness. Because, let's face it, we need all the protection we can get from some crazy electromagnetic waves!\n\nAnd just to spice things up, let's throw in some random layers. Who doesn't love surprises, right? So buckle up and get ready for some unexpected twists and turns!\n\nLast but not least, the dimensions of our model will be a wild and whimsical 5268.58 centimeters wide, 3589.05 centimeters tall, and 1254.24 centimeters deep. Because in our world, dimensions are anything but ordinary!\n\nAnd to top it all off, the central frequency will be a mind-melting 4.286 gigahertz. Get ready to rock and roll with some electrifying waves!\n\nSo there you have it, my friend.

        "input": "Alright, listen up folks because we've got ourselves a real cucumber situation here! Picture this: I want to chuck in a gigantic cube of cucumber measuring 25.295x55.9361x26.6585 meters, with a side length of 5.6564 (because why not?). But hold your horses, we gotta make sure the discretisation step is exactly 137.17999999999998 centimeters - precision is key, people! \n\nNow, did you know that cucumbers have their own fancy permittivity? For this bad boy, it's 2.2787, with a conductivity of 0.9233 (I can't make this stuff up!). Our trusty Hertzian Dipole, let's call it Tx, will be the life of the party, providing us with some electrifying vibes. And guess what? The internal resistance of the voltage source for this is a whopping 34.14965005803694 Ohms. It's got some serious stamina, I tell ya!\n\nBut let's not forget about the all-important pulse polarization. We're going with 'x', because why not mix things up a bit? And get this, we want the FDTD to run for a specific number - 2751 iterations. Not 2750, not 2752, but 2751. Gotta love that precision!\n\nNow, let's talk PML (perfectly matched layers). We want these to be 10 cells thick - because who needs thin layers when we can go big, right? Oh, and when it comes to layers, we're feeling adventurous. It's time to get random! \n\nBut wait, there's more! We need the pulse to be ricker - yes, a ricker pulse. Because who doesn't love a good pulse of rickers? And guess what? Cucumbers aren't the only stars of the show, we also have Sublime in the mix. Its permittivity is a mind-blowing 14.2456, with a modest conductivity of 0.5995. Can you handle all this electrifying goodness?\n\nOh and by the way, the dimensions of our model are a massive 5034.9400000000005 x 8953.38 x 3514.85 centimeters. We don't do things small around here!\n\nLast but not least, we need to know where to place our trusty source. Let's go with coordinates 3.1138, 0.786, 14.7042 meters - because location is everything, my friends! And speaking of placement, we're not stopping at cucumbers, oh no. We're adding a cube of Sublime too! Its left edge will be at the mind-blowing coordinates of 32.1518x47.9914x33.8171 meters, while the right edge will be 42.8464x59.8871x49.2623 meters. Can you feel the excitement?\n\nOh, and let's not forget our receiver! We're setting it up at the slightly eccentric coordinates of 669.84, 50.96000000000001, 1837.07 centimeters. Because when it comes to receivers, we like 'em a little out of the ordinary.\n\nSo there you have it, my cucumber-loving, ricker-pulsing, randomly-layered friends. We've got ourselves an adventure in electromagnetics! Let's buckle up and get ready for some wild waves!",

The internal resistance of the voltage source is determined to be 905.7974430112415 Ohms. Our transmitter, known as a Hertzian Dipole, will operate accordingly. Now, let's add a cube with the dimensions of 74.5006 x 40.5715 x 7.2518 meters, with a size of 0.6525. The receiver should then be placed at coordinates 1540.5900000000001, 3603.94 centimeters.

Its polarization will be set to 'y'. The FDTD simulation will run for a total of 25363 iterations. Lastly, the dimensions of the model will be 9224.27 x 4941.46 x 974.55 centimeters.

Gotta keep things super accurate in here!\n\nOh, and get this, the polarization of the pulse? It's gonna be so 'x', you won't even know what hit ya!\n\nBut wait, there's more! I wanna add a cube with Cucumber. Yep, you heard me right. It's gonna be a massive 34.2022x9.7228x10.7043 m! And, oh boy, the size is gonna be a whopping 14.8703.\n\nNow, hold on tight 'cause we're diving into the dimensions of the model, which are a mind-blowing 3949.35 x 5118.29 x 4007.5499999999997 cm! It's like a big ol' puzzle piece, ready to be assembled.\n\nNext up, we're gonna spice things up with a cube containing Sundial. Picture this: the left edge at 22.6763x40.9655x27.5255 m and the right edge at 32.7728x49.271x49.1237. It's gonna be time-tastic!\n\nFor the receiver, let's plop it right at 1540.5900000000001, 3603.94 cm. We gotta make sure it catches all the electric vibes!\n\nNow, let's get crazy and make some random layers. Who doesn't love a bit of randomness, am I right?\n\nThe central frequency is gonna blow your socks off at 1889.481 MHz. Get ready to groove to those electric beats!\n\nTo top it all off, we're gonna place the source at the coordinates (13.5718, 40.7309, 12.5384) meters. It's gonna be the epicenter of all things electric.\n\nFor the time window, we're lookin' at a cool 2.4201994931078067e-05 seconds. Time flies when you're having fun, my friends!\n\nNow, here's the dealio, the excitation pulse is gonna be oh-so-gaussian. It'll be smooth as butter, trust me.\n\nAnd let's not forget about the juicy deets on the permittivity and conductivity of our lovely Sundial and Cucumber. Sundial's got a permittivity of 18.519 and a conductivity of 0.964, while Cucumber's rockin' a permittivity of 23.5928 and a conductivity of 0.2651. They've got their own electric personalities!\n\nLast but not least, we gotta make sure our PML is nice and thick, 50 cells to be exact. We're talkin' serious electric protection here!\n\nHope that tickled your funny bone and shed some light on your electric journey. Have a shockingly fantastic day!",

The permittivity of Elephant is a mind-blowing 9.1201, and its conductivity is a crazy 0.2936. Elephants got some funky properties, man!\n\nNow, let's ignite this party with an excitation pulse called \"gaussiandot\". Trust me, it's gonna make our calculations boogie down!\n\nGuess what, my friends? Our trusty transmitter is gonna be a Hertzian Dipole. Yeah, it's gonna send electromagnetic waves in style!\n\nBut wait, we gotta spice things up a bit. Let's randomly generate some layers. Because, you know, randomness makes everything more exciting!\n\nNow, imagine this: we're gonna place the receiver at a super precise location of 2482.42, 5295.02 cm. Yeah, we're talking scientific precision here!\n\nOh, and we can't forget about the discretisation step. Let's make it a funky 35.8 cm.

        "input": "Alright, let's spice things up a bit!\n\nHere's the funny version:\n\nHey there! So, guess what? The discretisation step is a whopping 11.469999999999999 cm. Bet you didn't see that coming!\n\nNow, picture this: I want to add a box with Octopus in it. Yeah, you heard me right, Octopus! And get this, the left edge of that box should be at 2.0493x7.9777 and the right edge at 2.9357x8.6043. Octopus has really specific demands, you know?\n\nOh, and don't even get me started on the source. It needs to be placed at the coordinates (18.2101, 2.8946) meters. Talk about being precise, huh?\n\nThe dimensions of the model? Well, buckle up for this one - they're a whopping 4099.26 x 1401.31 cm. That's bigger than, like, everything!\n\nNow, brace yourself for an electrifying fact: the internal resistance of the voltage source is a mind-boggling 691.6788118661714 Ohms. Can someone say shockingly high?\n\nTo add some spice to the party, we're going for a Gaussian excitation pulse. Because why settle for ordinary when you can have a pulse that goes boom?\n\nDon't forget about the PML, though. It needs to be 61 cell thick. Thick like a milkshake!\n\nNow, hold on to your seats because we're about to dive into the world of Sapphire. Did you know its permittivity is 15.2847 and its conductivity is 0.4589? It's like a gem with some electric sparkle!\n\nOh, time flies when you're having fun! That's why the time window is going to be a measly 2.7823604818112227e-05 seconds. Blink, and you'll miss it!\n\nMoving on to Rx. We're going all out with coordinates like 7399.639999999999, 3244.03, 1063.49 cm. Yeah, we're aiming for the stars!\n\nBut wait, there's a twist. The central frequency will be a mind-blowing 273657.202 KHz. Can you even hear that?\n\nSwitching gears, let's talk about Tx. It's no ordinary dipole - it's a Hertzian Dipole. Fancy, huh?\n\nNow, this is the moment you've been waiting for - we're adding another box, this time with Sapphire. Picture it at 17.5393x6.391 m. And to complete the package, the size of this box is a grand total of 3.657. Perfect for those fancy gems!\n\nOh, did I mention Octopus has even more surprises? Its permittivity is a staggering 21.0429 and its conductivity is 0.612. Can you say electric superstar?\n\nAnd last but not least, forget about following any rules - let's just generate random layers. Who needs order when you can have chaos, right?\n\nSo, there you have it - a wild ride of specifications and demands. Hang on tight, because things are about to get electrifying!",

Time flies when you're having fun!\n\nWatch out for resistance! The internal resistance of the voltage source is a whopping 694.5349457277243 Ohms. It means business!\n\nLet's pick a pulse. How about a gaussiandoubleprime? It's got that spicy double action!\n\nWe gotta place the source at some fancy coordinates. How about (25.1672, 44.4508) meters? We like to be precise!\n\nNow, the discretization step is gonna be 15.329999999999998 cm. Small and feisty!\n\nTime to receive some signals! Place the receiver at (3668.85, 2669.66) cm.

        "input": "Alrighty then! So here's the plan, my friend. We're gonna spice things up and add a fruity cube - an Apple cube, to be precise. It's gonna be 25.2817x13.3084x6.7603 meters, with a teeny tiny size of 0.6746. Watch out for those seedy bits!\n\nNow, let's talk about Rainbow. The permittivity of Rainbow is a mind-boggling 24.8024, and its conductivity is a tinsy winsy 0.0629. It's oh-so-colorful, but not very conductive, you see.\n\nMoving on to the dimensions of our model, buckle up for these numbers. We're talking a whopping 7980.679999999999 x 3498.31 x 871.5999999999999 centimeters. That's a whole lot of length, my friend. Be ready to stretch those measuring tapes!\n\nOh, and let's not forget about our buddy Rx. We're gonna place it at the coordinates 579.45, 5160.67, 2839.04 centimeters. Rx, you've got a prime spot, my friend.\n\nNow for the fun part - the central frequency. Get ready for some high-pitched action, because it's gonna be a mind-blowing 257752.244 KHz. That's some serious frequency shaking there. Get your dancing shoes on!\n\nBut wait, there's more! We're not done with the cube extravaganza. How about adding a cube with the mighty Apple? This time, we'll start at the left edge of 58.6869x33.5702x8.5767 meters and end at the right edge of 60.6802x34.3159x33.6128. We're gonna keep it fruity and fresh, my friend.\n\nNow, Apple has its own set of characteristics. Its permittivity is a modest 11.4616, and its conductivity is a dinky 0.0284. Not the juiciest numbers, but hey, Apple has its charm.\n\nWhen it comes to discretisation step, we'll take it easy and go for 164.16 centimeters. We wouldn't want any hasty measurements now, would we?\n\nLet's add some excitement with an excitation pulse. We'll go for a fancy one - the \"gaussianprime\". It's gonna make some waves, my friend. Get ready for a pulse like no other.\n\nNow, let's throw in some randomness with some random layers. Life is too short to be predictable, after all. Let's shake things up a bit!\n\nWhen it comes to the pulse's polarization, we'll go for the letter 'y'. Y for yellow, y'all! It's gonna give our pulse a little personality.\n\nTime to talk about the PML - the perfectly mysterious layer. We're gonna make it thick, my friend. 42 cells thick, to be exact. We want our waves to be properly protected, you know?\n\nNow, let's talk about resistance. The internal resistance of the voltage source will be a precise 506.22115308830183 Ohms. We're talking resistance with a twist, my friend.\n\nAnd finally, we're gonna let the algorithm do its thing for a solid 15851 iterations. It's gonna work its magic, one iteration at a time. Trust the process!\n\nOh, and not to forget, our buddy Tx - the Hertzian Dipole. It's gonna bring the party to the electromagnetic world. Get ready for some electric vibes, my friend!",

Yeah, it's got some serious powers.\n\nYou want the PML to be 14 cell thick? No problemo, my friend! We'll make sure it's nice and chunky. Gotta protect those precious experiments, right?\n\nNow, it's time to choose the pulse polarization. You want it to be 'x'? Well, okay then! Let's give that pulse some attitude.\n\nHold up, let me tell you about the dimensions of this model. It's a whopping 3179.27 x 6184.86 cm. That's a whole lot of space for some serious shenanigans!\n\nOh, and don't forget about the internal resistance of the voltage source. It's 10.338854264692499 Ohms. It's like a little resistance warrior, ready to fight off any electrical villains.\n\nNow, let's jazz things up by adding a box with Tarmac. We're gonna place it at 11.1554x13.7353 for the left edge and 21.6255x21.4621 for the right edge. Man, this box knows how to boogie!\n\nGet ready for some serious action, 'cause we're gonna run the algorithm for 22334 iterations! Let the calculations party begin!\n\nNow, here's the deal with the central frequency. We're gonna set it to a crazy 4070348.47 KHz. Get those waveforms grooving!\n\nThe discretisation step is gonna be 151.54000000000002 cm. Yeah, we like to keep things precise and wacky at the same time.\n\nLast but not least, the pulse itself. It's gonna be gaussiandot. Yeah, that's some funky wave shaping right there.\n\nBut hold up, we've got more wildness to add! Let's throw in a box with Tesseract. It's gonna be at 14.7888x23.6727 m, with a size of 1.2511. That's gonna turn some heads, my friend!\n\nAnd finally, we've got the Hertzian Dipole, Tx. This bad boy knows how to radiate like it's nobody's business. \n\nOh, and just so you know, the permittivity of Tarmac is a sky-high 11.7764, while the conductivity is a slick 0.6884. These materials ain't messing around.\n\nAlright, my friend, now you're all set for some wacky, electrifying experiments! Let's go shake things up in this mighty universe!",

It's like that one cousin who always causes trouble at family gatherings.\n\nNow, imagine a PML that's 41 cells thick. It's like a fortress protecting our signals from the outside world. No unwanted guests allowed!\n\nSpeaking of signals, we've got one that lasts for a whopping 5.13236359993635e-06 seconds. It's like a quick, sneaky ninja running past you before you even notice.\n\nAnd get this, our discretisation step is a cool 6.140000000000001 cm. It's like taking small, stylish leaps towards greatness. Watch out for those centimeters!\n\nBut wait, there's more! We're adding a cube with Flamingo inside. Picture a majestic flamingo living inside a 18.1102x9.6077x39.3835 m cube. The cube itself is a solid 10.3951 size package. Now that's a fancy birdhouse!\n\nWe need to place the source at coordinates 14.3518, 24.9201, 21.035 meters. It's like giving GPS directions to a lost electron. You got this, little guy!\n\nNow it's time for another cube, but this one comes with a Balloon. Its left edge starts at 7.546x13.3318x30.3208 m and the right edge is at 24.3633x54.9029x25.5377. It's like a magical disappearing act - poof! Where did the edges go? They're here, they're there, they're everywhere!\n\nOur model has dimensions of 2904.0299999999997 x 5961.07 x 4350.87 cm. It's like our very own tiny universe. Watch out for miniature planets!\n\nOh, and did I mention Flamingo has a permittivity of 19.0736 and a conductivity of 0.2475? That's one electrifying bird! Don't mess with the Flamingo gang.\n\nLet's generate some random layers because life is too short to follow patterns. Embrace the chaos!\n\nOur central frequency is a mind-blowing 356242.804 KHz. It's like hitting the frequency jackpot! Party in the radio waves!\n\nThe transmitter (Tx) is a Hertzian Dipole. It's like a cool DJ spinning electromagnetic beats. Pump up the volume!\n\nWe should place the receiver (Rx) at coordinates 579.45, 5160.67, 2839.04 cm. It's like sending secret messages through electromagnetic coordinates. Keep it stealthy!\n\nOur pulse has the magical power of 'y' polarization. It's like a disco ball of electromagnetic waves. Let's dance to the pulse!\n\nLast but not least, Balloon has a permittivity of 10.5958 and a conductivity of 0.976. It's like a conductor at a circus, juggling electromagnetic currents. Bravo, Balloon!\n\nHope that puts a smile on your face while diving into the world of dimensions, frequencies, and electrifying animals. Enjoy the ride!",

Now let's talk dimensions, we've got a model that's a whopping 3947.06 x 8550.02 cm (that's a whole lot of duck real estate).\n\nNow, when it comes to exciting pulses, we've got the gaussiandotdotnorm doing its thing. And to keep the pulse properly polarized, we'll go with 'y' (because that's the cool way to go). For the receiver, let's place it at the coordinates (1699.6200000000001, 4926.45) cm (seriously precise reception, folks).\n\nTime to dive into some PML action. We want it to be 59 cells thick (because we like our PML like we like our pancakes, thick and delicious). Oh, and don't forget about the internal resistance of the voltage source, it's a whopping 994.2218446305861 Ohms (we're all about that electrical resistance, baby).\n\nNow, let's move on to Juxtaposition. Its permittivity is a whopping 17.1684 (because Juxtaposition likes to play with big numbers) and the conductivity is 0.937 (Juxtaposition loves to conduct some serious business). We want to add a box with Juxtaposition, with the left edge at 16.2132x10.2826 (because edges need some love too) and the right edge at 20.8524x58.2743 (because Juxtaposition likes to take up space).\n\nBut wait, there's more! Let's add a box with Quack at 11.8731x59.3954 m (because Quack wanted a fancy spot) with a size of 4.2463 (because Quack likes to keep it cute and compact).\n\nAlright, time for some random layers (because sometimes chaos is just more fun).

No funny business allowed, just some accurate placement!\n\nNow, the PML needs to be thick and juicy, like a 97-cell sandwich. Trust me, you're gonna want that thickness.\n\nTime is ticking, quite literally. The time window should be 6.607373727611592e-07 seconds. Not a moment too late or too soon.\n\nOur trusty ol' Tx is a voltage source. It's got the power, baby!\n\nWe're gonna put that source at the coordinates (1.2121, 20.081, 34.1924) meters. Let's give it a good home, shall we?\n\nWhen it comes to excitation, we're going full-on Gaussian. Gotta love those smooth pulses!\n\nNow, here's the fun part. The permittivity of Elephant is a whopping 13.6523, and the conductivity is a shocking 0.6664. That's quite the electric elephant!\n\nLet's jazz things up with some random layers. Because predictable layers are just boring, am I right?\n\nOur center stage frequency is gonna be 504.005 MHz. It's gonna rock your world!\n\nAdding more fun, we're gonna put a cube with Elephant inside. The left edge is gonna be at 4.6813x6.8685x39.8556 m, and the right edge at 40.6044x65.4205x12.2231 m. It's gonna be an elephant-sized cube!\n\nNow, let's talk dimensions. The model is gonna be a beastly 5223.25 x 6737.76 x 5907.889999999999 cm. That's one big mama!\n\nOh, and we can't forget about the glorious Sky. Its permittivity is a sky-high 7.7751, and the conductivity is a tad bit shy at 0.4464.\n\nPolarization time! We're gonna go with the pulse's 'x' factor. It's gonna be crossing all its t's and dotting all its i's.\n\nAnd last but not least, the discretization step is gonna be a hefty 23.62 cm. Because small steps are for tiny feet!\n\nOh, and the internal resistance of our trusty voltage source is a fancy 43.440799818942224 Ohms. It's got the resistance to go the distance!\n\nThere you have it, my friend. A funny twist to your technical requests. I hope it brought a smile to your face!",

Trust me, this cube is gonna blow your mind!\n\nOh, but that's not all! I'm also gonna add another cube named Pineapple. And get this, it's gonna be all juicy and sweet at the coordinates 28.8636x14.0371x30.0658 m. But wait, there's more! Pineapple will also have a size of 22.263. Talk about a fruity surprise, huh?\n\nNow, let's talk about the receiver. We're gonna place it at the perfectly chosen coordinates of 31.8598, 25.5486, 22.902. Oh, and let's make things interesting by setting the pulse polarization to 'y'. Gotta keep things fun and unexpected!\n\nFor our source, we're gonna use a Hertzian Dipole, because why not? We'll place it at the same coordinates as the receiver, because they are just destined to be together, you know?\n\nNext up, we need to make some magical walls with a thickness of 94 cells. These walls will create a force field that no unwanted signals can penetrate. Awesome, right?\n\nLet's not forget about the voltage source! Its internal resistance is gonna be a super precise 703.6566343856762 Ohms. I know, it's an oddly specific number, but hey, we like to be accurate in our funny world!\n\nNow, here's where things get really funky. We're gonna use this pulse called gaussiandoubleprime. It's like a regular pulse, but with a twist! And to make it even more exciting, we'll make the duration of the signal a mind-blowing 3.5537088451782935e-05 seconds. Ready to feel the pulse of excitement?\n\nOkay, time to bring it all together! We'll place our source at the same super cool coordinates as the receiver, because hey, they make a great team.\n\nNow, let's talk dimensions. Our model is gonna be a whopping 4766.24 x 6479.32 x 5139.24 cm. It's gonna be so huge, you'll feel like an ant in comparison! And just to keep things interesting, we'll use a discretisation step of 91.4 cm. Gotta keep everything big and chunky, just like our model!\n\nOh, and did I mention the permittivity and conductivity? Spectacular has a permittivity of 25.7097 and a conductivity of 0.9512, while Pineapple has a permittivity of 11.3565 and a conductivity of 0.4451. It's like they have their own special quirky properties!\n\nAnd the grand finale, random layers! Let's sprinkle them around our model because, let's face it, randomness is the spice of life!\n\nAnd there you have it, my friend!

That's one feisty resistor right there!\n\nNow, let's talk iterations. We want this FDTD thingamajig to run for exactly 25804 times. Not 25803, not 25805, but 25804. Gotta be precise, ya know?\n\nTime to add some pizzazz to this party! We gonna stick a cube in there, and we're gonna call it Lollipop. Its left edge should be positioned at a swanky 21.9408x12.9866x4.3944 m, and the right edge is gonna be at a wild 23.481x47.2362x13.829 m. Gotta make sure Lollipop is lookin' fine!\n\nNow, let's talk dimensions. The model we're working with is a whopper, measuring in at 2459.58 x 6462.820000000001 x 579.5600000000001 cm. That's one big mama right there!\n\nOh, oh! Let's add some funky layers into the mix. Gotta keep things interesting! Random layers are the spice of life, my friends.\n\nNow for the PML (Perfectly Matched Layer), we want that bad boy to be 99 cells thick. Gotta keep those reflections in check, ya dig?\n\nLet's move on to Lollipop's properties. The permittivity is a mind-boggling 11.743, and the conductivity is a sizzling 0.9863. Lollipop is no ordinary candy, oh no!\n\nTime to set the stage for the central frequency. We're gonna crank it up to 1.222 GHz. Get ready to rock and roll!\n\nNow, onto the pulse. We're gonna go with a ricker pulse. It's like a musical instrument, but with electromagnetic waves. Cool, huh?\n\nNext up, let's talk coordinates. Rx is gonna chill at the coordinates 21.19, 5001.68, 551.97 cm. Rx is loved by all the gadgets, ya know?\n\nNow, time for Tx, the voltage source. Tx is gonna party it up at the coordinates 0.2119, 50.0168, 5.5197. Tx knows how to light up a room with its electric personality!\n\nOh, oh! We got another word to play with. This time, it's \"dolphin\". The permittivity of this random word is gonna be 5.9867, and the conductivity is gonna be a cool 0.4951. Dolphins ain't just good swimmers, they're electromagnetic too!\n\nLast but not least, let's add another cube. This one's gonna have the random word \"dolphin\" all over it. This cube is gonna be at a funky 6.5422x47.9879x4.6102 m, and it's gonna have a size of 2.3562. Gotta give those dolphins some room to swim!\n\nAlrighty, that's all folks!

'Cause you know, even a slight change in location can mess things up!\n\nOh, and don't forget, the discretisation step has to be 127.85 cm. Can't have any gaps in between, right?\n\nNow, let's talk about the pulse polarization. It's gotta be 'y'. 'Cause why not? It's a party up in here!\n\nOh boy, now it's time for some fruity fun. We're gonna add a cube with a size of 0.1218. But wait for it, it's gonna have a Banana at 21.5604x49.3835x2.8071 m. That's right, a fruity cube, folks!\n\nNow, let's talk about the model dimensions. They're a whopping 6550.2300000000005 x 5171.16 x 1584.54 cm. Gotta make sure we accommodate all that greatness!\n\nAnd guess what? Banana's got some properties too! The permittivity is 8.0691 and the conductivity is 0.3711. Oh, but wait, hold the phone! I made a mistake before. The permittivity of Banana is actually 19.0685 and the conductivity is 0.3568. Oopsie daisy!\n\nNow, let's not forget about the internal resistance of the voltage source. It's a grand total of 902.5757160268683 Ohms. Yep, it's gotta put up a fight!\n\nOh, and we can't leave out the central frequency. It's gonna be an impressive 2.1 GHz. That's right, we're going big or going home!\n\nLet's not forget about Tx, our voltage source. Gotta give it a shoutout too!\n\nNow, here comes the PML, standing at a whopping 71 cell thick. Ain't nobody gonna mess with that shield!\n\nAnd what about the excitation pulse? Well, it's gonna be gaussiandoubleprime. That's right, we're getting all fancy with our pulses!\n\nOh, and just for fun, let's add some random layers. 'Cause why not? Gotta keep things interesting!\n\nAnd here we go again with the fruity cubes! We're gonna add another one with a Banana. The left edge is gonna be at 23.7639x48.9685x8.4008 m, and the right edge is gonna be at 42.7778x49.9688x53.155 m.

You know that feeling when you're trying to decide between chocolate or vanilla ice cream? Well, our pulse is basically saying \"x\" to all other polarizations. It's a rebel.\n\nNext up, we need to place the Tx source. Picture this, we're putting it at the coordinates 19.0378, 54.2784 meters. Now that's precision right there. The excitation pulse will be a gaussiandot. We like our pulses with a little bit of flair.\n\nBy the way, our Tx source is a rockstar. It's a Hertzian Dipole, hitting all the right frequencies.

Ain't nobody got time for extra layers.\n\nNow, let's get groovy with the central frequency, which happens to be 2114297.181 KHz. That's a spicy frequency, if you ask me.

Yep, it's like a fancy electric spring loaded with power!\n\nOh, did you know that an elephant has a permittivity of 4.267 and a conductivity of 0.8941? Watch out, it might give you a shock!\n\nNow, let's talk about the discretisation step, the cool kid in town. It struts around measuring 28.82 cm at a time. Talk about precise!\n\nAnd hold your horses, because the excitation pulse is going to be a Ricker! No, it's not a fancy name for a sandwich, it's actually a type of pulse. \n\nWant to play a game? Let's make some random layers! Just like shaking a snow globe, but without the snow.\n\nNow, get ready for some coordinates that sound more like a secret treasure map. We'll place the source at (4.5617, 8.4603, 47.5749) meters. Start digging!\n\nOh, and did you know that Cerulean has a permittivity of 22.466 and a conductivity of 0.2617? It's like swimming in a sea of blue electrical power!\n\nWait, wait! Before we go any further, let's not forget about the internal resistance of our voltage source. It's 261.7189794774301 Ohms! That's a whole lot of resistance!\n\nNow, for the fancy stuff, we want our PML (Perfectly Matched Layer) to be 2 cell thick. It's like a limo of electromagnetic absorption, ready to party!\n\nLet's bring in a cube made of Cerulean, measuring 13.5845x39.3743x33.714 m.

No, it's not an algebra problem, it's just the way the pulse swings!\n\nLast but not least, we'll place Rx (the receiver) at the coordinates 456.17, 846.03, 4757.49 cm.

Pray tell, the central frequency shall resonate a harmonious symphony of 4050.81 MHz. The contours of our creation span an impressive expanse of 5802.92 x 3023.37 x 7517.24 centimeters. As for the pulsating waveform, let it be graced with the polarization designated as 'x'. The very locus of our source shall be at the coordinates of (14.624, 8.5771, 47.9327) meters. Now, marvel at the grandeur of the random word known as \"Serendipity\" and its ethereal attributes. Its imperceptible form exhibits a permittivity of 14.7224, intertwined with a conductivity of 0.767. In the realm of dimensions, the cube containing \"Serendipity\" shall arise at 16.2305x29.5714x45.6683 meters, its size a mere 11.7998. Let the PML, that guardian against the onslaught of chaos, stand resolute with a thickness of 87 cells.

So listen up and prepare to be entertained.\n\nFirst off, I want the PML (that's the fancy acronym for Perfectly Matched Layer, in case you didn't know) to be a whopping 66 cells thick. Gotta have those super thick layers, you know?\n\nNext, we need to place the receiver at some coordinates that sound like they're straight out of a math equation: (2621.94, 995.5600000000001, 1050.03) cm. Who knew coordinates could be so wacky?\n\nNow, let's talk dimensions. The model we're working with is like a gigantic block: 9476.130000000001 cm in length, 8124.5599999999995 cm in width, and 7308.27 cm in height. We're in big, big territory here!\n\nFor the pulse, we're going with a fancy name: gaussiandotdotnorm. Sounds like something from a sci-fi movie, right?\n\nNow, let's not forget about the discretisation step. We're going with 145.94 cm because, well, why not? It's a nice, round number, right?\n\nOh, and where are we placing the source? At the coordinates 78.2845, 15.2082, 24.1513 meters. Can you imagine seeing a source just floating around in mid-air? Hilarious!\n\nAnd just to spice things up, I want to add a cube with the oh-so-fancy name Elegant. It's gonna be 81.5598 meters long, 77.8209 meters wide, and 25.5218 meters high. But wait, there's more! This cube has a size of 17.6143. Can you handle all that elegance?\n\nNow, here comes the fun part. The source we're using is called \"Tx\" because, let's be honest, naming things can be hard. We're gonna let it run wild for 6969 iterations. Why? Because that number just makes us giggle.\n\nOh, and I almost forgot. The polarization of the pulse is gonna be 'y'. Y not, right?\n\nNow, let's get really crazy. We're gonna generate some random layers. Random, like a monkey on a unicycle juggling bananas. Don't ask me why, it's just what we do here.\n\nOkay, stay with me, because the central frequency we're working with is a mind-blowing 1.762 GHz. That's faster than you can say \"supercalifragilisticexpialidocious\"!\n\nBut we're not done yet. Brace yourself for a cube with the quirkiest name ever: Lollipop. This baby is gonna be a wild ride. The left edge starts at 58.9412 meters by 65.094 meters by 44.4363 meters, and the right edge reaches 83.1846 meters by 80.241 meters by 65.8612 meters. Talk about a sweet treat!\n\nOh, and let's not forget the important details. The permittivity of our Lollipop is 22.7153, and the conductivity is a super impressive 0.4125. Gotta keep things interesting, right?\n\nAnd finally, the internal resistance of our voltage source is an epic 323.8567555001379 Ohms. Now that's some serious resistance!\n\nAnd there you have it, a hilarious twist on your original request. Hope I brought a smile to your face!",

        "input": "Alrighty then! Here's the info, but in a funny style:\n\nSo, brace yourself! We're about to add a ridiculously huge cube with Serpentine material. Picture this: it's a whopping 21.9254 meters tall, 1.2613 meters wide, and 32.0106 meters long. And get this - the size of this cube is a mind-boggling 1.9482! It's like a skyscraper of cubes!\n\nNow, let's talk about Rx. We're gonna place Rx at these super precise coordinates - 5495.320000000001 cm on the x-axis, a whooping 226.57 cm on the y-axis, and 2314.76 cm on the z-axis. These coordinates are so specific, even the ants would be impressed!\n\nOh, and the central frequency we'll be rocking is 2.071 GHz. We're gonna hit that frequency so hard, it'll make your head spin! And hold onto your hats because the excitation pulse is gonna be none other than a good ol' sine wave. Time to get groovy!\n\nNow hold onto your seats, 'cause we're moving on to the source. We're gonna plop that bad boy right at these coordinates - 78.2845 meters on the x-axis, 15.2082 meters on the y-axis, and 24.1513 meters on the z-axis. Yup, it's gonna be out there, sending signals like nobody's business!\n\nLet's talk about Serendipity for a sec. The permittivity is a solid 18.6355, and the conductivity? A strong 0.4233. Serendipity ain't messin' around, folks! It's gonna conduct and permitt all day long!\n\nNow, the dimensions of the model are off the charts. We're talking 8398.789999999999 cm in length, 560.2 cm in width, and a colossal 4576.4800000000005 cm in height. This model is no joke, my friend. It's a monster!\n\nOh, and we're rocking a Hertzian Dipole for our Tx. It's gonna transmit signals like nobody's business. Get ready to be amazed!\n\nBut wait, there's more! We're gonna add another cube, 'cause bigger is better, right? This baby is made of Serendipity too. The left edge is gonna be at 3.6214 meters tall, 2.963 meters wide, and 24.3391 meters long. And hold onto your hats 'cause the right edge is gonna be even bigger at 50.7 meters tall, 3.295 meters wide, and 13.6985 meters long. It's like a cube party up in here!\n\nNow, when it comes to discretisation step, we're going with an oddly specific 7.28 cm. It's the perfect step for all your discretising needs!\n\nLet's talk about Serpentine now. The permittivity is a cheeky 8.3928, and the conductivity? A cool 0.3508. Serpentine is all about being electrically stylish!\n\nDid someone say PML? We're gonna make it 72 cells thick. That's right, we're going all-in with the PML! Ain't no waves getting through that thickness!\n\nOh, and as for the polarization of the pulse, we're keepin' it simple with an 'x'. It's the hip way to polarize, trust me!\n\nAnd just for fun, we're gonna generate random layers. Because why not add a little excitement to this already mind-blowing project!\n\nOh, and one last thing, my friend. The internal resistance of the voltage source is a whopping 821.1710526625042 Ohms. That's one powerful resistance right there!\n\nThere you have it, my friend. All the info you need, served up with a dose of humor. Now go forth and conquer those electromagnetic challenges!",

We need to place Rx at a super precise location, like 13.9099, 20.9859 meters. Precision is the name of the game, my friend!\n\nOh, and let's not forget about the PML. We're gonna make it 34 cell thick, 'cause thicker is always better. Safety first, people!\n\nBut wait, there's more! We're gonna generate random layers 'cause we love surprises. You never know what you're gonna get, right? It's like a reverse birthday present!\n\nMoving on, we need to place the source at the coordinates 42.4076, 21.2122. Gotta have those perfect coordinates, you know?\n\nNow, let's talk about Tx. It's gonna be a voltage source, 'cause we like to shock things up (pun intended). \n\nOh boy, we're not done yet. Buckle up, because we're adding a box with the very fancy name of Chair. It's gonna be positioned at 31.5078x67.8677 meters, and it's gonna have a size of 20.9928. We mean business, people!\n\nHere comes the technical stuff - the permittivity of Chair is 22.0287 and the conductivity is 0.3288. It's all about the science, baby!\n\nWe're gonna set the time window to a mind-bending 5.881708695709181e-06 seconds. Say whaaat? That's some precise timing right there!\n\nNow, let's not forget about Cerulean. Its permittivity is 12.8693 and the conductivity is 0.2458. We're talking serious stuff, folks!\n\nOh, and we need a central frequency of 4.97 GHz, 'cause we're all about that high-pitched action, baby!\n\nTo make things even spicier, we're gonna go with a gaussian pulse. It's gonna be like a smooth jazz concert, but for electromagnetic waves!\n\nWe want that pulse to be polarized in the 'x' direction. 'Cause, you know, it's all about that letter 'x'. It's hip and happening!\n\nLast but not least, we've got some impressive dimensions here - 4597.96 x 8640.85 cm. This model means business, people!\n\nBut hey, we're not done yet. The discretisation step is gonna be a hefty 87.8 cm. We're gonna make sure every inch counts!\n\nAnd there you have it, my friend - a funny and electrifying take on your request.

So, picture this: I'm going to add a fancy-schmancy box with a super cool Dolphin on the left edge at the mind-boggling coordinates of 31.8668x11.5007. And wait for it...the right edge is going to be at an impressive 55.9621x18.7326! Can you believe it?\n\nNow, hold your horses, because we need to talk about time. We want a teeny-tiny time window of 7.264179835975677e-07 seconds. I mean, who needs more time anyway? Time is overrated!\n\nOh, and let's not forget about the source. We're going to place it at the mesmerizing coordinates of (24.9738, 26.6749) meters. And, can you believe this? The discretisation step is going to be a whopping 179.38 cm. We like to keep things big, you see.\n\nMoving on to the nitty-gritty details about the Jellyfish. Its permittivity is a mysterious 20.4155. Ooooh, fancy! And to top it off, its conductivity is a sizzling 0.8955. You go, Jellyfish!\n\nOh, did I mention we're going to generate random layers? Because life's too short to stick to just one layer, right?\n\nBut wait, there's more! We're also going to add a box with the one and only Jellyfish at 48.5325x27.624 meters, with a size of 3.4413. Now, that's what I call a perfect box!\n\nThe permittivity of the Dolphin, on the other hand, is a solid 9.7525. And its conductivity? A humble 0.2053. Dolphins like to keep it chill, you know.\n\nNow, let's talk frequencies. The central frequency will be a mind-blowing 1409101.554 KHz. That's a lot of Hertz right there!\n\nTo spice things up, we'll use an excitation pulse called gaussiandotdot. Fancy, huh? And just to add a dash of craziness, the pulse's polarization will be 'y'. 'Cause why not?\n\nOh, and let's not forget about the internal resistance of the voltage source. Brace yourselves, folks, because it's a mind-boggling 669.9353459258494 Ohms. That's a whole lot of electrical resistance!\n\nAnd just when you thought we were done, we throw in a PML that's a whopping 64 cell thick. Safety first, my friends!\n\nFinally, the dimensions of our model are a jaw-dropping 5966.28 x 3049.46 cm. Size matters, people!\n\nSo, there you have it, my friends. Our wacky, yet exciting journey into the world of boxes, Dolphins, Jellyfish, and mind-boggling coordinates. Buckle up and enjoy the ride!",

It's like the LeBron James of resistance, ready to take on any electrical challenge!\n\nNow let's move on to the receiver. We're placing it at the coordinates (6976.3099999999995, 1093.23) cm. Better mark it with a neon sign so we don't lose sight of it!\n\nAnd speaking of dimensions, our model is a mighty 8551.529999999999 x 2033.8799999999999 cm.

It's like a surprise party for our electromagnetic friends!\n\nLast but not least, let's not forget about the discretisation step. It's a whopping 169.37 cm.

The permittivity is 21.8079 (who knew fruits were electrically active?) and the conductivity is 0.036 (don't let it get too charged up!).\n\nAnd speaking of cubes, let's add another one.

Gotta keep those veggies in check, you know!\n\nLet's not forget about the discretisation step. That's a fancy way of saying how finely we want to slice things up. Let's go with 135.75 cm because precision is key!\n\nOh, randomness! Let's generate some random layers while we're at it. Gotta keep things interesting, you know!\n\nTime to find a good spot for the receiver. How about we place it at 16.3906, 3.4866, 49.8058? Perfect!\n\nNow, the internal resistance of the voltage source. Let's give it a snazzy value like 374.75358806791036 Ohms. Gotta have that resistance, you know!\n\nTx, oh Tx! We're talking about a Hertzian Dipole here. That's a fancy name for wireless wizardry!\n\nAnd let's not forget about the pulse polarization. Let's go with 'y' for some funky pulse action! Gotta stay groovy!\n\nTime window, check! Let's set it at 2.108849650404108e-05 seconds. Just the right amount of time for some electrifying action!\n\nNow, we've got ourselves a central frequency of 0.561 GHz. It may not be the loudest, but it's got style!\n\nOh boy, dimensions! We're going big with 3058.98 x 9957.470000000001 x 6954.11 cm. That's one massive model we've got here!\n\nAnd finally, Cucumber's turn!

Picture this: the receiver needs to be placed at the quirky coordinates of (328.12, 1042.74, 1740.17) cm. We're mixing precision and humor, baby!\n\nHold on to your taste buds because it's time for some mind-bending dimensions! The model measures a massive 9116.81 x 1118.13 x 1824.94 cm. Woah, that's one giant cupcake!\n\nWe've got pulse polarization on our minds. The pulse is feeling a bit rebellious and wants to go 'x'. These pulses, always doing their own thing!\n\nBut wait, there's more! Let's not forget about another cupcake cousin, Aura. Aura's permittivity is a whopping 24.525, and its conductivity is 0.6356. This one's got some serious flavor!\n\nTime to get experimental and random! Let's add some random layers because, hey, why not? Life is too short for predictable cupcakes!\n\nNow for some math fun. The PML (Perfectly Matched Layer) needs to be a spiffy 37 cells thick. Can't let any flavor escape, you know!\n\nAnd now for some cube action. We're adding a cube with Aura, measuring a hilarious 74.6204 x 4.0078 x 11.3947 meters, with a cute little size of 1.0552. These cubes definitely know how to take up space!\n\nBut we can't leave out Cupcake! We're adding another cube with Cupcake, making sure the left edge starts at 69.8503 x 7.1911 x 7.6163 meters and the right edge ends at 86.4359 x 8.2994 x 12.0321 meters.

It's like a treasure hunt for the ultimate cupcake!\n\nAnd finally, the cherry on top. The excitation pulse is going to be... wait for it... gaussiandotdot!

Don't ask me why, it's just gotta be that way.\n\nOh, and get ready for a quick burst because the signal will only last a measly 1.4917990278879785e-05 seconds. Blink, and you'll miss it!\n\nNow, let's talk measurements. Our model is massive, like seriously huge, at 6453.28 x 2635.96 cm. It's almost as if we're building a skyscraper instead of a box. But hey, go big or go home, right?\n\nTo spice things up, let's generate some random layers. Because who needs order when chaos is so much more fun?\n\nNow, hold on tight, because we need a very specific discretisation step of 114.38999999999999 cm. I mean, why go for a nice, neat number when we can have all these decimal places? It's fancy, trust me.\n\nMoving on, our pulse is feeling a little self-conscious and has chosen to have a 'y' polarization. I guess 'x' and 'z' just weren't cutting it. You do you, pulse!\n\nAh, the PML. We need it to be a whopping 66 cell thick. I mean, we really don't want any signals escaping, do we? Safety first, folks!\n\nNow, let's talk resistance. Our voltage source has an internal resistance of 668.2724028937156 Ohms. It's like the Hulk of resistances, ready to power up anything in its path.\n\nAnd for some extra excitement, our excitation pulse will be a gaussiandotdotnorm. I have no idea what that means, but it sounds cool, right?\n\nTime for some geographical planning! The source will be placed at the coordinates 3.2812, 10.4274, 17.4017 meters. Yep, we're taking this experiment to new heights, literally!\n\nBut wait, we can't forget about the receiver. It will be placed at the coordinates (2648.16, 785.22) cm. Don't worry, receiver, you won't be left out of the action!\n\nOh, and let's not forget the permittivity of Encourage. It's a whopping 13.4038, and the conductivity is 0.5994. I have no clue what that means, but hey, we're adding some scientific flair!\n\nReady for the grand finale? We're adding another box, but this time it's a Cucumber box. Get it? Cucumber? It will be placed at 52.2562x18.223 m, with a size of 1.9815. I guess we're going for a more refreshing vibe now.\n\nLastly, we've got a voltage source named Tx, because why not keep things mysterious? And to top it all off, the central frequency will be a mind-blowing 51.284 MHz. Get ready to rock and roll, folks!\n\nAnd there you have it, a wild and wacky set of instructions that will surely keep us entertained. Let the experiment begin!",

The discretisation step should be a mind-boggling 199.64 cm (because why be ordinary when you can be strange?).

And his central frequency? Brace yourself: a mind-blowing 1823.954 MHz (seriously, prepare to have your mind blown!).\n\nNow, let's go find the receiver, who apparently loves to hang out at the coordinates 188.68 cm and 706.53 cm (they really need to get out more). Stay tuned to see if they actually pick up anything exciting!\n\nHold up, we've got a wild one! A cube with a Cactus (yes, you read that right). Its dimensions are a mind-melting 3.0815 m x 17.8378 m x 67.2657 m (it's a seriously prickly situation). And for good measure, let's make the size of the cube 1.7528 (because why not?).\n\nNow, the dimensions of the model are truly out of this world: 1079.33 cm x 3697.4400000000005 cm x 9976.810000000001 cm (we're talking intergalactic sizes here!). Just imagine all the crazy things going on in that model!\n\nLet's talk pulse, baby! It's gonna be a good old-fashioned sine wave (classic, yet timeless). And the pulse's best friend, polarization, is going to be 'x' (because why settle for anything else?).\n\nWe're in for some serious PML (perfectly matched layers) action! It's gonna be 21 cells thick (it's all about that extra padding, you know?).\n\nOhm my goodness, the internal resistance of the voltage source is a precise 311.8469981437554 Ohms (because accuracy is cool, or so they say). Expect some seriously shocking shenanigans!\n\nLight up the dance floor with the permittivity of Cactus, a solid 9.552 (now that's what I call electric!). And don't forget about its conductivity, a sizzling 0.5529 (making sure things stay hot in the desert).\n\nThe source wants to be fancy and chill at the coordinates (30.5482 m, 16.0336 m) (a true diva among waves). Let's see if it can make some waves with those coordinates!\n\nWe're in for a long ride, folks! FDTD (Finite-Difference Time-Domain) is gonna run for a whopping 2989 iterations (can you say marathon?). Buckle up, it's gonna be a wild FDTD ride!\n\nLast but not least, Jubilant wants to join the fun. Its permittivity is a cheerful 6.0363 (always looking on the bright side) and its conductivity is a peppy 0.5472 (shaking things up with a little sass).\n\nThere you have it, my friend!

Now, Sizzle is no ordinary spice - it's gonna make this cube hot stuff! We're talking dimensions of 18.083x11.8511x25.3439 meters, with a size of 1.9889. It's gonna be smokin'!\n\nNow, hold onto your hats, 'cause we've got an internal resistance of the voltage source that's gonna blow your mind - 129.93645785607967 Ohms! That's some serious resistance right there.\n\nAnd check this out - our discretisation step is gonna be a whopping 90.73 centimeters. We like to take big steps around here, no tiny baby steps for us!\n\nBut wait, there's more! We've got another cube - and this one is all about elephants. You read that right, folks, Elephant is the name of the game. Now, this cube is gonna be a showstopper, with left edge coordinates at 2.38x34.7883x44.4123 meters and right edge coordinates at 18.0539x40.1749x46.0755 meters. It's gonna be mammoth!\n\nNow, let's talk about the characteristics of our Elephant cube. The permittivity is 10.4454, which means it's gonna be a great conductor of... Elephant-icity? And the conductivity is 0.9924 - that's some electric behavior right there!\n\nAnd remember our Sizzle cube? Well, it's got a permittivity of 2.1848. Not as impressive as Elephant, but still pretty cool. And the conductivity is 0.2917 - it's got a little spark, just like you!\n\nNow, let's get polarized! The polarization of the pulse is gonna be 'x'. That's right, we're going all-out with the power of the letter 'x'!\n\nSize matters, right? Well, the dimensions of the model are gonna blow your mind - 1834.01 x 4117.61 x 6494.14 centimeters! We're going big, baby!\n\nAnd hold onto your frequency meters, cause the central frequency is gonna be a mind-blowing 1479119.15 KHz! Get ready for a sonic spectacle!\n\nNow, let's talk about our voltage source, Tx. It's gonna be our star player. We're gonna place it at the coordinates (89.3452, 12.2149) meters. It's gonna be the life of the party!\n\nBut all good things must come to an end, and our time window is gonna be a mere 2.707541220437959e-05 seconds. Blink, and you might miss it!\n\nLast but not least, we've got our receiver. Picture this - it's gonna be placed at the coordinates 0.5364, 27.6626, 17.3555. It's gonna be like a secret agent, picking up signals and making us all feel important!\n\nSo there you have it, folks - a funny twist on some serious technical stuff.

So unpredictable!\n\nThe Paradox has a permittivity of 6.9094 and a conductivity of 0.9005. It's like a mystery wrapped in an enigma, my friend.\n\nDon't you just love numbers? The internal resistance of the voltage source is a mind-blowing 530.9826181126825 Ohms. It's truly electrifying!\n\nNow, let's talk about discretisation. We're gonna take some pretty huge steps, like 117.75 cm ones. Big strides, my dude!\n\nWhen it comes to placement, we're gonna put the Hertzian Dipole, aka Tx, at 2.6052, 55.0111, 28.2775. Just hangin' out, doing its thing.\n\nAnd the receiver? It's gonna chill at 125.92000000000002, 135.47 cm. Just sittin' back, waiting for the action.\n\nOh, and the PML? It's gonna be a chunky 71 cells thick. Gotta keep things nice and contained, ya know?\n\nAnd last but not least, the model itself. It's gonna be a whopper, measuring in at 8484.74 x 2606.2000000000003 cm. Talk about larger than life!\n\nSo there you have it, my friend. Let the fun and craziness begin! Good luck with your wild and wacky project!",

Picture this: its left edge needs to be at 0.0507 times the mind-blowing 36.3952, while the right edge should groove to the funky beat of 0.0665 times the epic 58.0273. Can you feel the groove, baby?\n\nOh, but wait, we can't forget about our PML party! We need it to be 27 cells thick. We like it thick, y'all!\n\nNow, let's talk about the Plate's specs. Its permittivity is a jaw-dropping 15.6758, and it's got a conductivity of 0.523. That's some electric personality right there! But hey, let's not leave out the Sunflower! Its permittivity is a sweet 5.7892, matched with a conductivity of 0.7109. Talk about floral power!\n\nNow, for a little fun, let's have our excitation pulse do the \"gaussiandotdot\" dance. That's right, we like 'em fancy and double-dotted!\n\nHey, guess what? We're not done yet! Let's throw in some random layers because, hey, life is all about surprises, right?\n\nAh, but we can't forget about the internal resistance of our voltage source! It's a sassy 621.5857115486959 Ohms. Keep it cool, baby!\n\nAnd speaking of voltage sources, we got our very own Tx in the house. Let's give it a round of applause, folks!\n\nTime is of the essence, my friend. Our time window needs to be a mind-bogglingly short 1.4457967293751085e-05 seconds.

Let the waves wash over you!\n\nNow, let's get down to the nitty-gritty of discretisation. Our step size should be 103.10999999999999 cm. We like it precise, baby!\n\nWait, hold up! Our model's got some serious dimensions. Brace yourself: it's a whopping 117.21 by 6144.27 cm.

Its permittivity is 16.3691, and its conductivity dances to the tune of 0.2476.\n\nNow, let us gaze upon the dimensions of our model, a vast canvas measuring 6611.22 x 9606.55 cm. \n\nIn order to capture the intricate details of our world, we shall divide it with a discretisation step, a stride of 198.59 cm. \n\nWith great longing, I beckon the FDTD, the Finite-Difference Time-Domain, to traverse a grand total of 18151 iterations in its quest for truth and understanding.\n\nAs we dive deeper into the abyss of randomness, let us introduce a collection of arbitrary layers, for randomness thrives upon the unexpected.\n\nAh, the frequency that shall guide our endeavors shall resonate at 3149.525 MHz, a harmonious vibration indeed.\n\nNow, dear observers of our fantastical realm, let us contemplate the nature of Giraffe. Its permittivity gracefully reveals itself as 7.4628, while its conductivity dances with a confidence of 0.9117.\n\nIn the spirit of randomness, I beseech you to envision the emergence of yet another box. This time, let it bear the name Giraffe, and may it find solace within the confines of 37.1292x21.7285 meters, its mighty presence embodied by a size of 16.937.\n\nAs we seek to capture the wonders of our creations, let us place a receiver at the coordinates (4831.9400000000005, 306.12) cm, for it shall witness the profound interactions of our spectral realm.\n\nThe pulse, steered by the whimsy of our desires, shall don the garb of polarization 'y', granting it a sense of purpose and direction.\n\nFinally, let us embark on a journey to establish the source, a beacon of illumination, at the coordinates (53.1063, 23.4932, 10.7513) meters, an origin from which the enchantment shall unfold.",
